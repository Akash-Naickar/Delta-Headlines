This comes amid tightening

presented by this develop

Most European brands sourc

Sonalika: The Impossible Indian Success Story
Sh. L. D. MITTAL
Chairman Sonalika Group
India is blessed with visionaries whose relentless efforts
have left an indelible mark and touched the heights of
success. In a candid conversation, the visionary tractor
titan, Sh. LD. Mittal, Chairman of Sonalika Tractors
shares how his dream of empowering the farming
community became the cornerstone of this unbelievable
Indian success story.
Q. Sonalika's growth story is unbelievable. What is the
success mantra behind this?
Sonalika was bom in a small non-Industrial town of Hoshiarpur
in Punjab and has risen to be in the list of Fortune 500 India
2024 Largest Companies with an overall tumover of estimated
US $1.1Bn. This is beyond imagination, yet true. What brought
us here is a strong belief of providing global technologies to our
farmers to ease their work and enhance farm productivity,
irrespective of the scale of operations. Since inception the
foundation of Sonalika is built on 3 philosophies - Offer
best product and services to our customers, prioritise
stakeholder interest and do business with highest
standards of ethics and take no shortcuts for excellence.
In the early days when we started manufacturing threshers, we
were clear that we had to give the best products, often making.
cost a secondary consideration. The approach helped us to
win the confidence of the farmers and understand their needs
inumately. We were overwhelmed with their response and they
requested us to make superior quality bractors as well. This
encouraged us to enter the tractors business in 1995. There
has been no looking back ever since with Sonalika winning the
hearts of millions of farmers across the country and globally
with its customer-centric approach to provide high quality
tractors, backed by a reliable service and spares support
We made this lougher by imposing our own self-discipline in
business principles and conviction to grow, with our self
resources. The ride was not easy and often, there were

questions of survival,
Howeverton each,
occasion we emerged
stronger by sticking to our
principle of remaining
debt-free This has
helped us in thinking
differently and doing
things differently that has y

firmly believe that Koshish karne walon ki kabhi haar nahl hoti..
This approach has kept us focused in design and develop our
own farm technologies to offer varied solutions for each
customer segment.
The success of our customers has led the company to record
(numerous milestones in the joumey so far that cannot be
expressed in words. We take pride in being the No.1 tractor
export brand from India, operating under a proud Indian name;
tractors a month today. We are always close to our customers
and ensure that we understand their growing needs and
quickly improve our products to meet the requirement.
During the initial veas
years our requests to our suppliers for
modifications in engines and other aggregates were not
entertained by them on account of our low volumes. That is
when we decided to build our own capabilities to make tractor
components in-house, be it engines, transmissions, sheet
metal gear box and so on to ensure that the necessary
modifications are done quickly and needs of our customers are
fulfilled, Eventually, the demand for our heavy-duty tractors
kept increasing exponentially and became so high that we
decided to expand our manufacturing prowess which today is?
the World's No.1 fully integrated tractor plant in Hoshiarpur...
This state-of-the-art manufacturing plant rolls out 1 tractor:
every 2 minutes, backed by robotic operations and automated
production lines which are flexible to make different engines,
and transmission on the same assembly line. Till date, the
plant remains unmatched in its capacities Today, we develop

brand that strives for excellence in every aspect of the
agriculture sector and consistently surpasses industry growth,
a statement of trust that customers have in us.
Q. How did you make sure to deliver the best solutions to
the customers and stay true to your philosophy?

has helped us to create a complete business ecosystem
around our factory. To further enhance our technical expertise
and offer the best solutions to customers, we tied up with
global companies such as Renault & Yanmar,
I feel delighted to see happy faces of the farming community
and it keeps me inspired to do everything that can to simplify
their lives and support and make their life better. Delivering top
quality products and services that consistently exceed
customer expectations has been our No. 1 priority. We stand
committed to innovate continuously and address: every
farmer's needs and keep refining our strategies to deliver
supreme customer satisfaction
Q. What is the philosophy of Sonalika towards its
stakeholders?
Sonalika believes that everyone who is associated with us is a
part of One Big family and everyone is important. One case in
point is the COVID-19 pandemic that tested industries globally,
and Sonalika was no exception. However, Sonalika stood as a
shining example of resilience and care for its partners. We
prioritized employees by paying their salaries in advance
during uncertain times and did not lay-off a single worker
Every supplier was paid-off on time and even in advance so
¿that they too could take care of their employees and business
needs. Sonalika takes pride in its family-oriented culture,
which has helped us to navigate challenging times with unity
and strength
Our decisions and actions are guided by the core values of
integrity, empathy and accountability. These shared values
uphold ethical standards, fostering trust and credibility for our
stakeholders, creating an all-inclusive environment of
transparency and commitment.
""The philosophy has gone a long way in building a perfor
led work culture that believes in teamwork and its only purpose
is to improve every day. We have examples of employees who
started with us and are head of departments now, dealers who
<started as small businessmen and have turned into business
tycoons and suppliers who have grown big with us: The
Sonalika family is built on trust and that converts into loyalty
and dedication towards our business, Numbers will keep
growing, what is more important for us is our belief in our
people. We are proud of the family of over 8,000 employees..
and over 20,000 vendors & dealers.<
Sonalika is committed to be a trustworthy partner of over 17/
lakh farmers globally. It not only provides best in class tractors,
but also believes in transparency in its dealings with the
farmers. It is the only company that displays its tractor prices!!
on its website, unlike many other traclor companies. The
company has also ventured into NBFC services to assist
farmers with financing options.
Q. What is y
message to aspiring entrepreneurs?
""Ae jazba-e-dil agar main chahun har cheez muqammil ho
Jaaye, manzil ke liye do kadam chalun aur samne manzil aa
faaye these words by Mirza Ghalib inspire me work hard
every day and yet believe that there is no shortcut to success.
Focus on hard work and execution over mere ideas and
presentation skills. True success lies in persistence and action
frather than waiting for external validation or funding., Take
ownership of your future!
In conclusion, we believe that farmers' prosperity is integral
to the growth of not just the tractor industry but also the
economy as a whole. Sonalika remains committed to its vision
of empowering farmers and achieving sustainable growth, I
believe my journey will be fulfilling when 'Kisan Ka beta bhi
Kisan banna chahega.""

DPDP Rules signal Meity's balanced approach,
but some concems still need to be addressed.
HE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH towards implementing the
Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act broadly reflects a
pragmatic and balanced strategy,considering the complexities
oftransitioning industries to a new legal framework. One ofthe
most commendable steps is the 45-day window provided for public con-
sultation. This time frame, coupled with the decision to release the draft
rules after the Christmas and New Year holidays, allows key stakeholders,
particularly global technology firms often operating with reduced capac
ities during this period, an adequate opportunity to participate mean-
ingfully in the feedback process.
www
60%
The government's nuanced stance on data localisation is another sen-
sible measure. Rather than imposing blanket restrictions, a government-
appointed committee will evaluate localisation requirements on a sec-
toral basis, ensuring that critical personal data remains within the
country's borders only when absolutely necessary. This selective approach
balances the need for safeguarding sensitive information with the oper-
ational realities of global businesses. For example, if the health ministry
is of the view that health record of citizens should not go out of the coun-
try, the suggestion will be reviewed through consultations before imple-
mentation,mitigating the risk of disruptions to cross-border data flows.
Equally prudent is the Act's provision for parental consent in processing
children's data. By requiring data fiduciaries to verify parental consent for
minorsunder18 through digital tokens, the government addresses the vul-
nerabilities children face in the digital world. This model strikes a balance
between safeguarding children's privacyand allowing access to digital plat
forms. It is a more practical alternative to Australia's restrictive approach,
where children up to a certain age are barred from accessing social media.
The DPDP Act also incorporates mechanisms to ensure transparency and
accountability, Provisions for voluntary disclosure of data breaches incen-
tivise organisations to proactively report incidents, fostering trust in the
data protection ecosystem. Simultaneously, significant penalties for non-
compliance underscore the seriousness of safeguardingpersonal data.Addi-
tionally, the thought that a two-year transition period should be given to
businesses to comply with the Act reflects the government's commitment
to ensuring a smooth shift to the new framework.
va
Plea
Electronics and information technology (IT) minister Ashwini Vaish-
nawhas clarified in the past that the DPDP Act adheres to the principles
established by the Puttaswamy judgment, which upholds the balance
between privacy and transparency. Existing laws mandating disclosure
of public servants'information will remain unaffected, addressing fears
of diminished accountability. It's a fact that by fostering collaboration
with stakeholders, prioritising sectoral needs, and adopting practical
measures like parental consent mechanisms, the ministry of electronics
and IT (MeitY) has taken a significant step toward ensuring robust data
protection while minimising disruptions to industry.
.
S
But there is a flip side as well. Retention of broad discretionary powers
under the guidelines leads to policy unpredictability, leaving too much
room for the government to act on a case-by-case basis. This could hamper
compliance efforts, as stakeholders struggle with unclearrules and incon-
sistent enforcement. The ambiguity and potential legal challenges may
benefit lawfirms, while businesses and stakeholders face heightened com-
pliance costs and regulatory unpredictability. Also, the entire process can

salted nuts are used. Excessive intake of
nuts and dry fruits like raisins and dates
can also elevate blood sugar levels. Hence,
it is advised to eat in moderation to avoid
too much calories and fat.
Here's what Neeti Sharma, head,
dietetics and nutritionist, Marengo Asia
Hospital in Gurugram, suggests:
""Almonds, walnuts, pistachios, cashews,
and raisins are healthy nuts with diverse
health benefits if eaten in moderation.
Almonds are rich in vitamin E and
magnesium, so it helps for healthy skin
and reduces stress. Six to eight almonds
daily are ideal,""
Similarly, walnuts contain Omega-3
fatty acids that aid in brain and heart
health, and three to four halves are
sufficient. Pistachios help in weight
management and offer antioxidants, and
20 to 30 kernels are recommended.
Cashews, full of zinc, boost the immunity
system; four to five of them daily are
enough Raisins help digestion and
increase energy; one to two tablespoons
are sufficient.
Healthy eating
If you roast almonds, it enhances the
vitamin E absorption and improves
digestion, Pecans, when roasted, bring
out the natural oils, making antioxi-
dants more bioavailable. Hazelnuts, if
roasted, make vitamin E and copper
absorption enhanced.
...
When you soak cashews, it reduces
the fatty acids and makes the magne
sium, minerals and copper more
absorbable. They can also be taken raw
or roasted for energy and snacking b
g but
avoid the frying and addition of more salt
as they could lead to reduced health
benefits,"" says Dr Sharma of Marengo
hospital, Gurugram.
www.
Pistachios, when soaked, become soft
and are easily digestible. Walnutsmaybe
taken raw to obtain the benefits of
omega-3 fatty acids, Roasted lightly,pis-
tachios can also be flavoured withoutlos-
ing significant nutrients, ""Also make sure
to store thesedryfruits in such a way that
their nutritional value is preserved. You
can consume dry fruits with warm liq-
uids like tea and milk to enhance diges-
tion,"" says Dr Grover of Max, Vaishali.
Dry fruits and nuts are very easy to
include in your winter diet to become
healthy. Soaked almonds and raisins
can help jump-start your day for some
energy.Addchopped walnuts,pistachios,
or cashews in oatmeal, porridge, or
yoghurt. These nuts can be incorporated
in homemade energy bars,laddus, or gra-
nolaforyour snacking. Mix dry fruits, like
dates and figs, with warm milk,perfect
for a healthy drink to take to bed,
Add chopped nuts over salads or soups
for crunch.
Also, the timing of having dryfruits is
important. ""They can be consumed
throughout the day, but ideally in the
morning or as a mid-morning snack,
Avoid ingesting them late at night since
they may disturb digestion,"" says Dr
Gupta of Fortis hospital.
Meanwhile, nut allergy is one of the
most prevalent food allergies in both
children and adults, with some experi-
encing severe,life-threatening responses
when exposed to nuts, says Dr Gupta of
Fortis, Thesymptoms of a nut allergycan
range from minor to severe, For some,
even tiny quantities of nuts can be fatal.
""So, if you have a nut allergy, you should
educate yourself, take care to minimise
exposure,and know what to do if you get
symptoms. Look for alternative foods
that people with tree nut allergies can
eat, such as pine nuts. Soaking dried
fruits overnightmight make them softer
and more digestible,"" adds Dr Gupta of
Fortis hospital, Max
The safe options, says Dr Grover of
Max, Vaishali,are dry fruits like almonds,
dates, prunes and raisins as they do not
cause such allergic reactions. He further
advises to be careful while selecting the
nuts and dry fruits ""Try almonds,
cashews, and pistachios. Start with small
portions and you may increase the quan-
tity of the portion after monitoring your
body reactions. Avoid keeping dry fruits
in a single box, try to keep them individ-
ually so that you can prevent any acci-
dental exposure, ""he adds

Worrying signs
from the Arctic
Scientists say fires in

www
IN A YEAR FULL of troubling signs that
Earth's dimate is rapidly changing,some of
the most alarming signals came from the
Arctic. The thawing tundra has become a

said Brendan Rogers, an Arctic scientist at
the Woodwell Climate Research Centerin
Falmouth, Massachusetts. ""There's
big changes in the rivers, and
with salmon, and big changes.
in the atmosphere, and with
sea ice, and ocean produc-

One area of particular
concern is the increase in
wildfires. Fireseason is get-

regions and the Equator that drives air
currents that move high and low pressure
systems around the globe. Major changes
to the Arctic will most likely have far-
reaching consequences, thoughscientists
can't yet predict exactly what they will be.
1.
The thawing Arctic is also shaking up
geopolitics. With sea ice melting,new ship-
pinglanes are opening up Asaresult, Rus-
sia and China have sought to project their
influence in the region in recent years. That
has led Canada to stepupits military pres-
ence in the region and seek to work more
closely with the US, Meanwhile, tensions
between Russia and the Westhave resulted
in scientists being shut out of the Russian
Arctic,compromising efforts to collect reli
able data on one of the largest and most
significant swaths of the Arctic,
Have we hit a tipping point?

Another point of acute concern: Parts
of the Arctic that have long stored carbon
are now turning into sources of carbon.
Recently, the National Oceanicand Atmos-
pheric Administration announced that the
Arctic tundra has in recent decades been
""adding more carbon dioxide to theatmos-

What happens in the Arctic

alter global weather patterns. It's the tem-

Scientists can't yet say that the
changes being observed in the
Arctic are irreversible, or that
they are accelerating and
compounding And other
permafrost areasare still net
carbon sinks, or natural
reservoirs that store more
carbon than they emit. Still,
things are moving fast up
north. The Arctic is warming
four times as fast as the rest of the
planet. In the waters that connect the
Atlanticand the Pacific Oceans in northern
Canada, sea ice was the lowest everrecorded
in the period from October of 2023 to Sep-
tember. In Canada's Western Arctic, thaw-
ing permafrost is triggering landslides and
making itanearcertainty that some villages
will have tomove. This summer, theeastern
half of Hudson Bay, home to the world's
most-studied polar bears, was ice-free a
month earlier than usual.
Agroup of scientists also recently wamed
that the Arctic could experience its first day
that is practically ice-free by 2027. And, for
the 11th year in a row, the Arctic was more
abnormallywarmthan the world as a whole.

Gunjit Jain, Executive Vice-
President, Marketing, Colgate-
Palmolive India talks to
Alokananda Chakraborty about
why the company is bankingon
technology and premiumisation to
drive growth Editedesarts
www
LX
Please take us through the..
technology input in your latest
oral health campaign.
We call it the oral health
movement ratherthan another
ad campaign. We startedit
because a large number of Indians
have oral health issues but hardly
anybody goes to the dentist. So,
nobody realises they have an issue
until it turns painful.
wwwwwww
The reality is that we are all
supposed to go to a dentist
regularly but only 1 out of 10.
Indians did last year. In other
*
words, oral health awareness is
anissue. To make it simple for
people, we've come up with an
Al-enabled WhatsApp-based
tool where you can answer a few
simple questions, take 3
pictures of your teeth, sendit,
and in an instant you get an Al-
screened dental report. We've
also tied up with the Indian
Dental Association and we have
access to 50,000 dentists. So,
you can just put in your pin
code and you will get a free
dental consultation.
We've got resounding
feedback from the industry,
from consumers and we've got
several thousand screenings
done already. The most
important thing is this is not
a one-time ad, it will
continue so we are calling it
a'movement'.
Howmuch time did the
whole process takeand
how are you dealingwith
the issue of data
security?
J
It's been more than a yearin
themaking and the number
one reason is when we get
into AL, it comes with alot of
responsibility.We are collecting
first-party health data of
individuals, including their
D
www
pictures. So confidentialityand
the robustness of the technology is
key. The data we are collecting has
to be used only forthe purpose for
which it is being collected.
*30*
What steps are you taking to
improve percapita toothpaste
consumption?
Here we have to focus on the
*difference between penetration
and consumption, Toothpaste as
a category has universal
penetration in this country.
Every household in urbanand.
rural India has toothpaste at
home, which wasn't the case 10
years ago,But does that mean
PER CAPITA
CONSUMPTION OF
TOOTHPASTE IS BEHIND
SOME OF OUR
NEIGHBOURS
LIKE THAILAND OR
THE PHILIPPINES
that people are using toothpaste
and brushing often enough? The
answer is a resounding no. The
per capita consumption, which
is the grammage of toothpaste.
used per individual in the
country, is behind some of our
neighbouring countries like
Thailand or the Philippines...
About 80% of urban Indians
do not brush at night, they only
brush once a day.55% of rural
Indians brush not daily but
occasionally.And nobody goes to
the dentist. As market leaders,it
is our responsibility to make
people realise that brushing
every day not just in the
morning but also brushingat
night reduces the chances of
cavities by 50%,
www.w.wall
The company has also spoken
about driving growth through
premiumisation.Can you
elaborate?
Oral care has lagged in
premiumisation. Why so? Avery
honest answer is that for several
years the market leader, which is
Colgate,did not invest in
generating awareness and
driving that seriously. And it is
our responsibility to do it.
We've picked it up ason
Sone of
the key strategies for growth.
You need superior products that
can deliver perceivable superior
benefits. You need superior
communication to convince
people that this is the right
thing. We've got products on
three specific fronts, For
anybody who's proactive
about their oral health, we
are owning the
preventive"" segment with:
our flagship product
Colgate Total. Second, for
those who want teeth
whitening, which is oral
beauty, we've got Colgate
Visible White.And then
for people who've got

EXPERTS WARN OF UNCERTAINTIES
Re closes
Market rally at another
riding on
high hopes
AKSHATA GORDE
Mumbai, January 2
ATATIME when market experts have
been advising investors to prune
returns' expectations from 2025, the
benchmark indices 2.3% surge in
the first two days has raised hopes
that the stock market may deliver
strong returns this year. Market
experts, however, aren't impressed,
pointing out that the fundamental
concerns of expensive valuations,
earnings downgrades,shallow inter
est rate cuts, and low gross domestic
product remain.They also cautioned
about near-term uncertainties with
Donald Trump taking charge in the
US, and the Federal Reserve's policy
meeting at theendofthe month...
*The last two days have been an
exceptionas domestic, and on Thurs-
day,even foreign investors are front-
loading their expectations on hopes
ofapick-upin consumption and bet-
ter-than-expected corporate earn-
ingsin theupcoming results season.
Other contributing factors include
good auto sales numbers, decent GST
collections in December, strong quar
terly deposit growth by banks, and a
positive outlook for the tech sector.
VKVijayakumar,chiefinvestment
strategist at Geojit Financial Services,
said Thursday's rally was
vas ""totally
unexpected, given the sustained sell-
ing by the FPIsamid the strong dollar
and the high bond yields in the US.<<
""Leading indicators available so
far do not indicate a pick-up in eco-
nomic growth. GST collections for
December have declined 2.97%
month-on-month, indicating con-
tinuation of the slowdown. There
fore, Q3 corporate earnings are
unlikely to register a rebound. This
means investors have to focus on seg
mentswhich will buck the slowdown
like IT, pharma, and to some extent,
financials. Luxury consumption like
hotels,jewelleryandaviation alsoare
likely to post good results,"" he said.

On the day, gains in most Asian

exploiting arbitrage opportunities
between the NDF and onshore

The widened gap between NDF

a surge in dollar-rupee forward

The forward premiums
retreated later on the back of dol

which can impact overall brain health.
CASHEWS: Cashews help in keeping you

defended the H-1B visa saying he could

Criticism and what the data says
CRITICS OFTHE H-1B visa argue that the
scheme undermines American workers.<<
While tech leaders who are part of
Trump's support base have backed the
visa programme, the detractors have
questioned the daim of a dearth of local
talent. Instead, critics view the problem
as one of tech firms considering
American talentas too expensive. Data
shows the criticism is not entirely
unfounded.Accordingto an analysis of

Ho How changes
could affect
Indian ITfirms
INDIA IS THE biggest beneficiary of the
H-1B visa among countries, with the
latest figures for FY23 showing that
72% of thevisas were issued to Indian
nationals. Indian IT firms gain the
most from the visa, initially granted
for three years but can be extended up
to six years. If the ongoing rowin the
US amid the nativist anger directed at
Indians leads toproposed changes
suchas increase in minimum wage,
requirements (currently at $60,000)
oradditional fees could lead toa
permanent shift in cost structures for
Indian IT companies, FE reported.
Financial costs relatingtowages, and
including increased compliance
burden, may have to be factored in.
Also, changed norms could make the
companies rethink their workforce:
strategies in the US, and they may set
up operations in places like Canada or
Mexico to service American clients,
FY23 were for annual salaries below
$100,000 (for IT professionals in the US,
the figure was $104,420). In FY23, the
medianannual income of people
approved towork in the US on H-1B visas
was $118,000. The corresponding
income for people in computerand
mathematical occupations in the US is
about $113,000. The vast majority of
approvals is for workers in science,
technology, engineering, and maths-
65% were forcomputer related jobs in
FY2023.H-1B visas aren't hinderingthe
rest of the workforce, experts point out.
o A tightrope
walk for Trump
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN made earlier to
restrict the H-1B visa programme..
During Trump's first presidential term,
he had promised to end the abuse of
foreign worker programmes, and a ""Buy
American, Hire American"" executive
order increased scrutiny of H-1B visa
applications with denial rates jumping
to 24% in 2018 compared to 5-8%
during the Obama years. Trump has
since taken a U-turn.Tesla, which is
headed by Muska big donor for
Trump's election campaign-had 724
H-1B visa holders the last year alone.
Although companies and insiders do:
not anticipate big changes to the H-1B
visa or green cards under Trump, he
faces a tightrope walk keeping his flock
of backers in Silicon Valley as well as his

Why have several states dropped out?
SINCE THE PMFBY'S launch in 2016,

Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and
Jharkhand have opted out of the
scheme while Punjab,which declined:
to join citing secured irrigation and
low indemnity level, approved it for
horticultural crops.States have dropped
out of implementing crop insurance
schemes because of risk perception and
financial or budgetary constraints.
The financial constraints of the state
governments and low daim ratio during
normal seasons are the major reasons
for non-implementation of the
scheme by these states,"" according to a
parliamentarypanel report in 2021.
Among these states, Andhra
Pradesh decided to implement the
PMFBY from kharif 2022 season, and
last year Telangana and Jharkhand
rejoined it. States such as Andhra
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha,
Meghalaya, and Puducherry have
opted for universalisation of the crop
insurance scheme, where the state
government bears the cost of
farmers'premiums.
What are
the financial
implications?
*THE TOTAL FINANCIAL outlay for both
the schemes have been increased to
**69,515 crore for 2021-22 to 2025-
26,from 66,550 crore for FY21 to:
FY25.The finance ministry has
allocated 15,000 crore for FY25,
while the revised estimate for FY24
stands at 14,600 crore. In FY23, the
government's expenditure on crop
insurance was 10,296 crore as many
states had dropped out. With the,
approval of funding till FY26,
agriculture minister Shivraj Singh
Chouhanhas said the crop insurance
schemewould continue beyond FY26
According to officials, as several states:
are in talks with the agriculture:
ministry to join the scheme,require-
ments for higher financial allocation
may be met in the next few years. The
flagship scheme will continue as
farmers are often facing weather
related challenges,officials said.
• Challenges in
implementation
SINCE ITS LAUNCH, the PMFBY was
compulsory for farmers who take a loan
from any financial institution, and
voluntary for non-loanee farmers.
But since 2020 kharif, it has become
voluntary forall farmers. There are long
delays in payments and compensation
paid to farmers, Yield-related disputes,
delayed transmission of yield data, and
delays by state govemments in releasing
their share of premium subsidy are the
major reasons for protracted settlement
of claims. The Centre has decided to
release its share of premium subsidy in
advance by delinking it from the release
of states' share in payment. For faster
assessment, claim settlement, and
reducing disputes, the cabinet has
approved the creation ofa 824-crore:
fund for innovation and technology for
ensuring tech infusion. Underthis fund,
weatherinformation and network data
systems, and yield estimation system
using technology, which deploys remote
sensing, are being setup.

estimates number will surely be achieved as growth in the second half of
the fiscal year can be expected to easily clock a growth of 6.7%. But the
headwinds could strengthen beyond that. Ifwe have to avoid another dis-
appointment in FY26, some immediate measures need to be taken to
resuscitate demand.
=
While private final consumption expenditure is tipped to growat 7
agood level on the face of it it is on a very weak base of only 4% in FY24;
The fact is that consumption may have been resilient at the top end for a
range of premiumgoods, but there is clearly very limited purchasing power
with middle and lower-income households. To bring relief to small enter-
prises and give their businesses a leg-up, the central bank must shift its pri-
orities and cut interest rates by a chunky 100 basis points in the next six
months. That could cheer the sentiment and boost retail credit which has
moderated sharply. To revive the credit impulse, the Reserve Bank of India
must ensure liquidity remains abundant, enabling lenders to mop up
cheaperdeposits. Without some succour for small units and middle-income
and lower middle-income households, it will be hard to revive demand.
The trade,hotels, transport, and communications segment is estimated
to grow at only 5.8% in the current year, the slowest pace in six years. This
sector generates employment in large numbers and the sluggish perfor-
mance probably explains the slow job creation in the country. In general,
the lack of job opportunities is worrying.Areport by FICCI-Quess Corphas
found that the compound annual growth ratein wages, across six sectors,
was just 0.8-5.4% in the 2019-2023 period. This was low not simply in
absolute terms but also did not cover for the 5,7% annual average inflation.
The increase in persons hired by aclutch of 1,196 firms fell to 1.5% in FY24
from 5.7% in FY23,revealing how companies are cutting back on hiring
To be sure, manyare opting to hire on contract but it doesn't seem like the
numbers are very large.

.
Real rural wages have been negative for a long time. Demand forwork
under the government's rural employment guarantee scheme was at a
four-month high in December, suggesting the rural recovery is not as
strong as is believed. The lack of visibility in demand is apparently hold-
ing back further investments by the private sector. While companies are
putting up capacity in several sectors, in aggregate the gross fixed capital
formation, expected to grow at 6.4% this year, could have been better.""
While the private sector must definitely commit more capital and hire
more, the government should up speriding meaningfully at least by
10% annually fora couple of years.As imprudent as it may sound,alit-
tle bit of pump priming is called for to ensure the economy doesn't lose
anymore momentum.

(PBD) convention, to be held in
Bhubaneswar from January 8-10,
perhaps gives us an opportune
moment to look at the Indian dias-
pora and evaluate its true potentialin.
giving shape to the Prime Minister's
dream ofa Viksit Bharat.
Estimated to be the world's
largest, the Indian diaspora with
35.42 million people residingoutside
India as of November 2024 includes
15.85million NRIs and 19.57 million.
PIOs, It has a significant impact on
India's economy, contributing
around 3.5% of the country's GDP
through remittances. In 2023, India
retained the top spot with remit
tances of $120 billion, nearly two
times ahead of Mexico ($66 bn) and
China ($50 bn).
Remittances are critical for any
country since they help cushion the
adverse impact of any fall in FDI and
higher trade deficit. For India too, the
steady flow of remittances has been
hugely beneficial and it is estimated
to top $124 billion in 2024 and $129
billion in 2025.
Apart from the sheer numbers,
what also works in India's favouristhe
diverse composition of these remit
tance inflows, which is predicted to
provide steadiness in case of economic
downturns. The US, the UK, and Sin-
gapore,which collectively account for
36% of total remittance flows, are the
primary destinations forhighly skilled
Indian migrants in the IT and services
industries. The UAE accounted for
18% of remittance flows,while Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar,col
lectively accounted for11% of India's
total remittances. Thediversification.
of India's migrant pool, between a
large chunk of highly skilled migrants
working in high-income OECD mar
kets and less skilled migrants in the
GCC markets, could impart stability
to remittance inflows in the event of
externalshocks.

URVI MALVANIA
Mumbai, January 2
EDTECH FIRM UPGRAD will focus
more on high margin businesses
like upskilling courses rather than
formal education formats in order
to drive profitability as it prepares
for an initial public offering seven
to nine quarters down the line,
majority shareholder Ronnie
Screwyala told FE.
Profitability will further be dri
ven by the ""top-up and tank-up""
phenomena for the firm, he said, as
more professionals in India look to
acquireadditional skills, and inter-
national customers, most notably
in the North American market,
look to upskill and gain a compet
itive edge.
The firm, which doubled its
revenues in FY24 over FY23 is
looking at a growth of 35%-40%
CAGR in future, though growth in
the year ending March 2025 will
be lower. ""We wanted to swing
completely to everything being
profitable. We wanted to see that
anything that was too much of a
burn for us to get growth, we will
not do it,"" Screwvala said.
This includes dialling back on
the university led education verti
cal where the ed-tech firm gets
70% margins as compared to the
non-university led modules where
margins can be upwards of 90%,he
added.Currently, 40% of upGrad's

Dunzo's

Dunzo could get it all done.
Its popularity with con
sumers attracted Google's first
direct startup investment in
India-a$12.3 million Series B
round in 2017, for a 19.3%
stake. This came when many
investors were hesitant about
the hyperlocal delivery space,
with several similar ventures
struggling to survive. At the
time, Google had cited Dunzo's!
ability to execute as the reason
to invest in the company.
The trajectory shifted sig-
nificantly in 2022 when
Relianceinvested $240million
fora 27.6% stake, according to
Tracxn Atonestage, Biswas's net
worth was estimated at over
*6,000 crore. The Reliance
investment led to aggressive
expansion plans and a pivot to
quick commerce through
Dunzo Daily. ""We
underestimated the
complexity

and cost of quick commerce
While our competitors were
focused on unit economics, we
were trying to solve inventory
management with tech solu
tions that looked good on paper
but didn't translate to the real
world,"" a senior ex-employee
would later admit.
Cash-rich competitors like
Zepto, Blinkit and Swiggy Insta-
mart quickly moved far ahead
in the quick commerce space,
leaving a gap too wide for
Dunzo to catch up. In an effort
to recalibrate, Dunzo exited the
segment, and got back to its
original model of hyperlocal
deliveries for nearby grocery
stores and those on the ONDC
network. It also tried to become
a delivery partner for retailers
and merchants who had their
own online stores, but had to
revert to its B2C model as if
lacked funds to expand in the
B2B segment.
WIN AN
The past 18 months have
seen Biswas attempting to res
cue his startup. From negotia
tions with Reliance Retail foran
investment of around $20 mil
lion, to its efforts to raise $22-
25 million through external
investors, nothing seems to
have panned out as potential
investors do not seem to be con-
vinced of its ability to revive,
One of the service level
agreements the
PORTRAIT: SHYAMKUMAR PRASAD
company had with Reliance
was to turn cash flow positive..
By FY23,Dunzo's losses had
jumped to 1,801 crore in FY23
from 464 crore in FY22.
Though the company's FY24
financials are not available,
internal sources suggest Dunzo
now operates with 40,000 daily
ordersand 50 employees, down
from its peak workforce of
2,000. This has
helped the com-
pany breakeven;
with a massively
reduced scale.
However, accumu
lated debt of
around *600 crore
makes recovery
difficult without

The startup that raised
nearly $470 million since
inception and once exemplified
Indian entrepreneurial success
now serves as a cautionary tale
about the perils of rapid expan
sion and shifting focus from
core strengths. From its peak
valuation of $770 million,
industry insiders now estimate
Dunzo's acquisition value
between $25-30
million.
Though the

financials are not

sources suggest
Dunzo now

The company's financial
troubles have also led to legal
problems, with a groupofcredi
tors filing an insolvencyapplica-
tion in July, alleging partial clear
ance of dues. Meanwhile, all.
ex-employees are still awaiting
a resolution on promised

in timing the market. That's why we
maintain minimal cash levels.

Bhavish Aggarwal's Ola Electric,
meanwhile, has been struggling to
regain share plagued by a surge in
customer complaints about poor

multi-brand dealer network that
would complement its direct-to-

retailers would not bear the cost
of the inventory, which typically
accounts for 25-30% of the total
cost of a traditional dealership. The
tabforthe marketing and promotion
costs would be picked up by Ola. The
company has added 3,200 new
stores, taking its total network to
4,000 showrooms and service cen-
ters nationwide. Ola got off to a fairly
good start in 2024 strong, selling 1.2
lakh units in the first quarter. There-
after, sales volume started falling:
and; volumes in Q2 sales were down
to 1,08 lakh units and in the Sep-
tember quarter to 94,171' units. By
the last quarter of the year, volumes
had dropped off to sub-85,000 units.
Experts say the company needs
to address the issue of after-sales
service before it can see a meaning-
ful pick-up in volumes. Jeffery Jacob,
Partner and Head (Automotive) at
KPMG in India,points out that while
the D2C model helps new players
scale up quickly, it is the physical.
store,
network that ensures sus-
tained sales and helps address ser
vice concerns.
Over 2024, Ola sold 4.07 lakh
units while TVS and Bajaj together
sold alittle more at 4,1 lakh units. But
it promises to be a whole new space
this year with alot more competition.

WHEN GOOGLE UNVEILED its new

announcement created a lot of excitement
and curiosity in the tech community around
the world. The breakthrough marks a
significant development in quantum
computing a field of computer science that
promises to disrupt everything from
healthcare to finance to scientific research.
Because in under five minutes, Willow can

DELHI TO Chandigarh is a painful

There's a new route we discov-

it's longer, you have to pay more toll,
but saves you both fuel and time,
and takes you via two expressways.
The regular route]
It's the old NH 1 nowcalled NH 44
(via Panipat, Kamal, Ambala, to
Chandigarh).Toll charges are *380,
but due to heavy traffic, we took 7.
hours to cover 280 km. The Taisor,
powered by 1.0-litre turbo-petrol
engine (*10,55-13.03 lakh,depend-
ing on variant), returned 15km/litre.
....
The new route
... You take Ambala-Hisarhighway
(NH 152), then the Trans-Haryana
Expressway (NH 152D), and then
the National Expressway 5 -NE 5,
from Delhi to Katra via Amritsar,
which then joins the Western
Peripheral Expressway near Delhi.
'
The Taisor covered this distance
of 295 km in 5 hours, and returned
21 km/litre (driven mostly on cruise,
control at 90 km/h). Toll charges,
however, were more (almost 600).
Why isn't it popular?
*WA A
Part of the reason is that neither
NH 152D nor NE 5 are complete-

on expressways you drive with min

which is more efficient than stop

It's cheaper, too. On the old NE

norms, QCOs are compulsory, requiring
manufacturers, importers and sellers to
comply with the prescribed norms..
The intent behind introducing QCOS

However, the industry's primary concem,

Globally, such mandatory quality

from the garments.
Fibre prices, sops

INDIAN FIBRE PRICES, includingthat
of cotton and MMF, are 12% to 30%
higher than those available to
competitors. That percolates down the
value chain,resulting in the erosion of
the cost-competitiveness of the
garments and made-ups. The
govemment needs to ensure raw
material availability at internationally
competitive prices by removing
import duty from all cotton varieties

indownstream segments, to attract
more investments
Leveraging free trade agreements
FOR THE TEXTILE and apparel sector, Free
Trade Agreements (FTAs) provide tariff
concessions, bettermarket access, and a
level-playing field against global
competitors. Recently India has signed
trade agreements with important T&A
markets such as the UAE, Australia and
Mauritius and has also signed a pact with
the European Free Trade Association
(EFTA). The industry is particularly keen
on finalising the FTA with the EU, the
second-largest export destination for
Indian T&A products..
To maximise the benefits of FTAs, the
government may also negotiate on the
various non-tariff/technical barriers that
Indian exporters might be facing while
exporting to these countries. For
instance, the EU and the UKare coming
up with stringent quality measures; at
the same time, the Indian govemment
through the BIS is also coming with
standards that are at par with
international norms. Both sides may
negotiate for mutual recognition of
testing and quality norms which will
further catalyse bilateral trade.

Cutting through the
hype on AI, RTO, and DEI
FROMA QUICK glance at 2024's top business headlines, you'd think all compa-
nies were pushing return-to-office (RTO) policies, embracing artificialintelligence
(AI), and banishing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes. But as we
head into 2025, let's remember that headlines don't always reflect reality,
Start with RTO mandates. The media loves a scary back-to-the-office headline,
From the point of view of clicks, a strict five-day-a-week policy is gold. Even bet-
ter? If that policy applies to liberal tech dweebs. Full points if it's a company that
once promised to work remotely forever, like X when it was still Twitter.
.<
These headlines gain attention because they play to some readers' anxieties
and others' schadenfreude, But the reality is that most companies have accepted
hybrid work. Even Elon Musk had to back off his declarations of full RTO at X;
shortly after his initial, well-publicised demands, he conceded there'd be excep-
tions. He also shuttered some of the company's offices, meaning that all staffin
those locations had to go fully remote..
Iexpect this dualityto ramp upin 2025, with more companies loudlyannounc

IN GROWTH WITH EQUITY
KAPIL SIBAL
Member of Rajya Sabha
D
RManmohan Singh
belongs to an era
when politicians
were respected for
allowing institu-
tions to flourish. It
is not as if there
were no aberrations in the
past. By and large, the spirit
of the Constitution was hon-
oured by those in power. Even
when Atal Bihari Vajpayee
was the Prime Minister (1999-
2001), he respected and heard
the voice of the opposition.
Narasimha Rao, on one occa-
sion, requested Vajpayee, who
was the Leader of Opposition
at the time, to lead a delega-
tion to the UN. It was during
those years that Manmohan
Singh, from being a bureau-
crat, who served the nation in
several capacities, became the
Prime Minister in 2004.
The opening up of the In-
dian economy, when a radical
shift was made in 1991, by
Singh as Finance Minister
with India's balance of pay-
ments in deep crisis. His eco-
nomic liberalisation policy
paved the way for what India
is today. Every sector of the
economy moved away from
the license quota raj and from
a 3.3% growth rate prior to
1991, we in the 1990s witness-
ing India's GDP growing at
6%. Between 2004 and 2014,
GDP growth averaged 7.7%
with 8.1% average growth be
tween 2004 and 2009.
Those were golden years,
when India's growth story
was lauded internationally
and 271 million people moved
above the poverty line. Eco-
nomic growth during these
years was tempered with eq
uity. Singh believed that
growth without equity, is not
the path India should tread,
His commitment to Parlia-
ment and Parliamentary in-
stitutions was unmatched. He
sat through the debates, lis-
tening to the opposition and
attempted, to the extent pos-
sible, to move forward with
consensus. He did not have
the luxury of a brute majority
in the Lok Sabha and there-
fore, had to navigate his poli-
cies through dialogue both
with his coalition partners
and the opposition. The dia-
logues, with his coalition part-
ners, allowed him to make
some monumental decisions.
The Right to Information
Act, 2005, brought about enor
mous transparency in the
process of decision making.
With information available to
citizens, government could be
held accountable, making
transparency a policy pre-
scription. The Right to Free
and Compulsory Education
Act, 2009, allowed 25% of chil
dren belonging to the poor
and marginalised communi-
ties to be admitted to private
schools where their education
was subsidised from Class I to
Class VIII. These changes in
many senses recognised that

Ranjit Shinde
ET Intelligence Group: A boo

ferings (IPO) continued to lure fo-
reign portfolio investors (FPIs) in
2024 as they were net sellers of In-
dian equities in the secondary
market amid rich valuations,
sluggish demand and slowing
GDP growth.
Given the sustained flow of com-

markets regulator as a part of the
IPO launch process, the domestic
primary market is likely to re-
main a major route of equity
investment for foreign
investors in 2025 as well.
In 2024, FPIs pumped
1.22 lakh crore ($14.5 bil-

This compares with the net to-

In addition, a bulk investment in

The domestic primary market
reported a strong flow of new offe-

SEBI PROPOSAL SEEKS TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN REGULATORY CONCERNS AND INTERESTS OF STAKEHOLDERS
L
The future of algo trading
AST MONTH, THE Securities
and Exchange Board of Indla
Sebi) proposed significant
changes to Its framework
governing algo trading. To
recap quickly, algorithrule trading, or
dgotrading refers to any trading activity
that automates trades, and does not
require manual intervention to place any
orders, or monitor prices.
There are two ways in which one can
carry out algo trading. The straightfor-
ward method is to use the algorithms
provided by the stock broker. The other
soulels through application programme
Interface (API), which enable electronic
systems to connect with each other,
Think of it as a data pipe which carries
your algorithm. Als enable the trans-
mission of information, and as a result,a
third party can create a code that willere
oute itself on the broker's platform.
In the context of algo trad log, third
parties provide their algo on say, plat-
form X, which is connected to the bro-
ker's platform through an API, Thus,
orders placed by the client on platform
Xget passed on to the broker. Now, while
a broker can identify that an order is
coming in through anAPI,It cannot ver-
ify that theorderisan algo order.
In 2021, concerned with the rise of
unregulated algus, Sebi proposed to treat
all AM orders as algo orders. This was a
flawed departure from Its mission to
encourage innovative and digital solu-
tions in the secudtles market, asthe regu-
lator's proposal would have saddled.com-
Dectivity between brokers and other
sophisticated players linked to them for
DoD-algo purposes. It appears that the
proposal has been scrapped, and after
extensiveconsultationswiththeindustry,
a more practical approach has been pro-
posed. With respectoAPIorders,Sabihas
suggested that an order per second (OPS)
threshold be specified, and that all APL
SANDEEP PAREKH
Managing partner, Finse Law Advisors
onlers above such threshold would be
treated as algo ordea.
Second, Sebi has proposed to bring
""algo providers"" (APS) within the regula-
tory ambil. These would be agents of
stockbrokers, similar to the present
""authorised person"" or the erstwhile sub-
broker concept.APs would also have to reg
isterwith the stock exchange and get thele
algus approved by the exchange. This
would ensure that thebroker is responsi
ble for customer grievances, and the
redress mechanism
deployed by Sebi would be
available to AP dients. Indi
viduals who design their
ownalgoswould also have to
get them approved by the
stock exchanges through
theirbooks.
along with a new report
The proposed framework places sig-
alficant responsibilities on stockbrokers.
They would have to put systems in place
todetect, Identify and categorise all orders
above the specified OPS thunshold asalgo
onders, They would also have to ensure
that they can distinguish between algo
and non-algo orders. Further, brokers
would no longer be permitted to offer
open APIs, to ensure Identification and
traceability of the vendor and end user
Atumaround time
must be specified
to register algos,
including a fast-
track registration
for some such as
white box algos
The regulator has also
sought to categorise algos
into white box and black box
algea.White box algos, also
known as execution algos, are those which
executeorders based on fully transparent
algorithms, where the logle, decision-
making processes, and underlying rules
are accessible and understandabletousers

define the roles and
responsibilities of brokers and empan-

turnaround time must be specified for
registration of algos, locluding a fast-

have to deploy additional resources. They
would be required to conduct post-trade

put in place a standard operating proce

have the ability touscakillswitchtostop

have to supervise/Inspect that stockbm-

annual EV sales drop
KARA CARLSON
January 2
TESLA'S ANNUAL VEHICLE sales
dropped for the first time in more
than a decade despite a year-end
push that sent deliveries to a record
in the fourth quarter.
The Elon Musk-led company
sold 1.79 million vehicles last year,
itsaid Thursday, which was slightly
less than what it delivered in 2023
and also below analysts' consensus
estimate.
The results offer a sobering
reminder of the real-world chal-
lenges for EV makers, even as hype
around driverless cars and Musk's
closeness with President-elect Don-
ald Trump have sent Tesla's stock
soaring in recent months, Luke-
warm consumer demand is weigh
ing on sales of electric cars, an issue
that could be exacerbated by
Trump's push to rein in EV incen-
tives.
Tesla's shares sank after the
results, falling 5.8% as of 10.49
amin New York. Thestockrose 63%
in 2024.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31,it
delivered 495,570 vehicles, missing
the 512,277 analysts had projected.
It needed to sell nearly 515,000
vehicles in the quarter to meet its
goal for ""slight"" growth in the full
year.
In a note to clients, Barclay'sana
lyst Dan Levy wrote that the data
offered ""no changetonarrative, but
reinforces challenge for❜25 growth
on existing models,relianceon still
unknown Model 2.5.""
Tesla faced a series of set-
backs in 2024,
including an arson
attack at its Berlin
factory, shipping
diversions and
an industry-wide
slowdown in EV sales.And it hastold
investors that demand for its all-
electrics is between two major
growth waves. In April, the Austin-
based automaker cut more than
10% of its workforce, including
sales staff.
Even so, Tesla said as recently as
October that it expected to achieve
modest growth in its deliveries for
all of 2024. The EV maker had
pushed a myriad of deals related to
financing, charging and leases to
end-of-year buyers.
Musk told investors on Tesla's
latest earnings call that he sees 20%
to 30% growth this year, fueled in
part by a more affordable vehicle
expected to be unveiled in the first
half and on the company's
autonomous technology. The EV
maker has said little about what
that new vehicle will look like or
what its price will be.
There isalready some doubtover
the company's ability to achieve
Musk's 2025 growth objective,par-
ticularly if EV tax credits are rolled
back under Trump. The president-
elect has been critical of Joe Biden-
eraEV policies and the EVtax credit,
which Musk claimed in July would
hurt Tesla in the near term - but
hurt Tesla's competitors more.
At the same time, Trump also is
expected to loosen federal rules on
self-driving vehicles, which could
benefit Tesla and its robotaxi ambi-
tions, Musk was a top Republican

ASHIMA GOYAL
Emeritus professor, Indira Gandhi Institute
of Development Research, Mumbai
INADDITION TO tohisinvaluable contri-
butions, Manmohan Singh has left pow-
erful lessonsforus with his personality as
well as his policy successes and failures
Asaperson heretained his gentleness,
humility, and simplicity, however exalted
his post. Lesson one thus is that decency
plus ability gets results,despite views to
the contrary. It gave him the opportuni-
ties he wanted to serve the country.
With his sharp intellect and deep expe-
rience within the system, he understood
what was feasible. While he did not waste
his time tilting at windmills, he showed
tremendous courage and persistence in
whateverheundertook. The sarfaroshiki
tamanna"" was clear inhisfamous Budget
speech. While we can wish he had done
more, especially in his second term as
Prime Minister, there were the compul-
sionsofacoalition governmentandaviti-
ated national atmosphere.
The Indian voter seems to have learnt
this lesson and has largely voted stable
governmentssince, both at the Centreand
in states while keeping competition alive
and often punishing non-performance.
The lesson for governments is that
although delivery is made more feasible,
re-electionisconditionalonperformance,
Many of the corruption allegations
during the second tenure of the United
Progressive Alliance (UPA) turned out to
beoverdone. Buttheyoriginated from too
much discretion in resource allocation,
evenas growth was driving up theirvalue.
Systemic improvements and a better
understanding among regulatory and
judicial institutions of necessity for eco-
nomic expertise did yield results.
Singh, as an RBI governor living through the permissive
1980s, understood the value of fiscal conservatism and
implemented it as finance minister
ital account convertibilityand had to rev-
erse its position after a series of financial
crises. They also demonstrated indepen-
dent,sophisticated, and relevant thinking.

gimeset then afteran initial doubledeval-
uation, and largely followed since. The
range of movement has varied butitcont-
inues to be market-determined, withint-
ervention only to preventexcessvolatility.
This ""middleway"" between fixed and
free-floating exchange rates reduced
volatility while preventing real misalign-
One of the lessons
for the government
While Singh's credentials as a liber-
aliser are justly celebrated, the fourth
under-appreciated lesson is the subtlety
and context-sensitivity of India's liberal-
ising reforms. They followed a gradualist
path carefully laid out by committees of
experts,consistent with India's structure
and needs. As an example, consider the
sequencing of capital account convert-
ibility, where liberalisation was more for
foreign direct and equity flows and the
least for short-term debt.
Debt inflows werecapped as
a percentage of domestic
market size. As a result,cap-
ital flows rose, along with
the deepening of the dom-
estic market. Thus,diversity
increased but volatility was
contained. This approach
saved India from spillovers
during the East Asian crises
or the large interest rate
volatility that Indonesia experienced dur-
ing the tapertantrum, evenas rising cap-
italinflows contributed to the sophistica-
tion of our markets. On this path towards
fullercapital convertibility,administrative
freedoms will rise, even as foreign capital
approaches a natural shareofabout 10%
in deep domestic markets, which will be
able to absorb its volatility.
today is the
importance of
improving its
finances during
good times
Thus, our policymakers understood
emerging market risks better than the
International Monetary Fund, which was,
in the 1990s,pushingstrongly forfull cap
ment without painfuldom-
esticdeflation or inflation
via multiple instruments.
Letting the currency freely
depreciate can cause real
exchangerate appreciation
through inflation, which is
less desirable than nominal
exchange rate appreciation.
This has sometimes helped
manage inflation in an
economy dependant on oil
imports. All emerging market central
banks hold reserves and intervene, which
servesanessential precautionary purpose,
reducing risk premia. Our policymakers,
with Singh atthe helm, understood these
issues in the 1990s, while textbook free-
marketers still do not.
As the controller of capital issues was
abolished, the Securities and Exchange
Board of India was set up. It was well
understood that liberalisation meant
smartly regulated, not free,markets.
Singh, as a Reserve Bank of India gov-
ernor living through the permissive
1980s, understood thevalueoffiscal con-
servatism and implemented it as finance
minister. However, his FMschose to spend
more,evenduringthehigh growth period
of the 2000s, and even more after the
global financial crisis. As money was
pumped into agriculture without reliev-
ingsupplyconstraints, food inflation Sus-
tained at double digits. Rural wages rose
so sharply that there was unprecedented
growth in real wages. But inflation soon
spoiled the partyas monetary tightening
lowered growth.Ina populous country,
rising agricultural productivity is a pre-
condition for sustained inclusive growth.
The lessonsforthe govemment today
are the importance of improving govern-
mentfinances in good times and of reliev-
ingthecrucialsupply-side constraints.For
example,current largemoney transfers to
low-income women will further increase
demand for a diversified food basket.
States, therefore, must first improve veg-
etable supply chains and removebarriers
to private participation in marketing.
Stroke-of-the-pen reforms are easy.
Domestic supply-side reforms, where
states are involved,arenot.UPA-Ilsuffered
because they opted for stimulus without
first clearing domestic impediments. The

THE EARLY HINT of India cap

the final Test of the Border-

came from head coach Gautam

he said at the pre-match press

throwdowns. There was no offi-

evening the word was out-
Rohit, who has been struggling
for
runs, had ""opted to rest""
while vice-captain Jasprit Bum-
rah would lead the side.
The team seemed to take the
change at the top in its stride.
After the press conference, Ro-
hit, Bumrah and Gambhir were
seen sitting in the bucket-seats
outside their dressing room -
chatting, back-slapping and
laughing. After this short meet-
ing, Rohit walked towards the
teambus,tobe greeted by a roar
from a small crowd lined upout
side. ""Rohit, Rohit,"" they cha-
nted, and the rested captain
gavea big smileas hesauntered
into the bus.
It was an unusual day. The

slated to start at 1.10 pm,
started neady half-an-hour late;

was in a meeting. Gambhirand
DREAM!!
DRITON
Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah in the nets, In Sydney
on Thursday, ahead of the final Test
Bumrah could be seen
engrossed in a long chat before
Rohit joined them.
Gambhir then walked the
corridor to the 'press-room'to
address the media contingent.
Veryeady in the interaction, an
Australian journalist asked
SHIRAH VEERA
about the captain's absence at
the traditional pre-game press
conference: ""Is everything
alrightwith Rohit?"".
Gambhir stiffened up.
""Everything is fine with Rohit
and I don't think it's (the cap-
tain's presence at the press con-
ference) anything traditional.
The head coach is here and that
shouldbefine,"" he responded.
But he slowly begantorelaxa
bit, and even smiled.Asked how
he was handling the difficult
period of transitionintheteam,
he said: ""It's the role of not only
the support staff but you people
(the media) as well. Howcanyou,
probably, not only criticise them
but try and help them out as
well?Transitionisnotonlyforus
Transition happensfortheentire

As ever with
Gambhir, there
were some frank
statements. He
talked about how
the Indian team
has ""lacked fight""
at times in this
series. ""We've got
an ""honest"" communication
with the players, he said: ""And
there were some honest words,
that's all can say And honestyis
very important. Honesty is
extremely important if you
want to probably go on and
achieve some great things""
In particular, Gambhir
addressed the need for playersto
strike a balance between playing
their natural game""and adjust-

part of Test cricket. I know we
have got to fightitout. And that's
probably one area where we've
lacked in this series,” hesaid.
Asked whether he had given
a stern talk to the players in the
dressing room, as reported by
The Indian Express on Wednes
day, Gambhir first said these
were ""just reports"", but went on
to add that he had an honest""
conversation with the team.
""Those are just reports.
That's not thetruth. And I don't
think I need to answer (on) any
reports, to be honest,"" he stated.
Going on to admit that he had
got to do it?
On the field later, the Indian
team seemed to be preparing for
lifewithout Rohit. The first point
of interest was the slip cordon,
the position where Rohit usually
places himselfat the start of the
game. The cordon had a new
face all-rounder Nitish Reddy.
A short while later,Gambhir
went down to the arena, fist-
bumped Shubman Gill and pat-
ted him on his back. Gill then
found Bumrah approaching
him-a shake of hands ensued
before Bumrah patted him on
the arm. It did seem like the
moment Gill was possibly told
that he would play, replacing
Rohit in the top order."

likely to cut interest rates from the

DONALD TRUMP IS crypto's messiah-
in-chief-conflict of interest aside, he
has some sweat equity in an upcoming
crypto venture too.
Hisnewfound cheerleading for crypto
is as baffling as it is laughable. Just a few
years ago,he dismissed cryptocurrencies
asa ""scam"" and a ""threat"" to the dollar.
This dramatic U-turn feels more like a
social media post hastily deleted after
realising its unintended implications.
Much likeachild captivated by a newtoy,
will this crypto fascination fadeoncethe
nextshiny object appears?
The irony hereisrich. Bitcoin, bom out
of a dream to eliminate middlemen and
even governments' control of finance,
now finds itself embraced by the very
intermediaries it sought to bypass. Wall
Street, as the representative of all woods
financial, has smartly been not content
with making fees off selling stocks, bonds,
insurance, debt arrangements, and
mutual funds.It hasnow turned its sights
(and political lobbying) on crypto.In its
essence,cryptoremains what it has always
been: a high-stakes gambledriven by retail
sentiment, devoid of intrinsic value, and
producing no cash flow. Think of it this
way: when you invest in a house, you're
betting on its ability to provide shelter or
rental income. When you investin stocks,
you'rebuyingashareinacompany'sprof-
its.But when you buycrypto,what exactly
are you investing in? A future without
banks? Autopia whereeveryone transacts
in blockchain tokens? Or is it simply the
hope that someoneelse will paymore for
it than you did?
Financial regulators across the globe
have consistently raised alarms about its
risks.Crypto's decentralised nature and
opacity make it conducive for illicit
activities like money laundering, terror
financing, and tax evasion. Yet, Trump
has emboldened the industry to push for
a regulatory free-for-all.
Consider the interconnectedness of

these safeguards may offer a smoother

a catastrophicphinge.
The stakes couldn't be higher for
global banking regulatory standards.
Frameworks like Basel III, designed to
ensure the resilience of banks, will be

extreme price volatility, coupled with its

Crypto's lobbyists,

Yet, Trump's return to
power promises to acceler-

ened by his support, are pushing for
regulatory rollbacks that would make it
easier for banks to integrate crypto into
their services. This isn't about innova-

for the rollback of crucial guidelines,

integration of such assets
without robust globalstan-

actors flock to jurisdictions
with the weakest rules.
Adding to this circus is
David Sacks, Trump'snewly-
anointed""crypto-Alczar"" Aman who has
spent his career criticising tech regula-
tion, Sacks seems an odd choice,given his
lack of expertise in either crypto orarti-
ficial intelligence. Then again, Trump has
never been one to let qualificationsgetin
the wayof appointments.
Even after 15 years of existence,
crypto still struggles to justify its place
in the world. It has no social purpose,
economic value, and track record of
improving lives. The industry's relent-
less marketing machine spins tales of
overnight millionaires, preying on the
""fear of missing out"" to hire in unsus-
pecting retail investors. Meanwhile, the
financial sector rakes in fees by ped-
dling crypto products that are little
more than sophisticated gambling
tokens. If this house of cards collapses,
the fallout could dwarf the global finan-

citizen will bear the brunt.
Regulators must hold their ground,
resisting the call of deregulation and
ensuring that crypto's integration into
the financial system is guided by pru-

A godfather's warning
Geoffrey Hinton, a British-Canadian
computer scientist who is referred to as
the 'godfather' of AI, has raised an alarm

20% chance of that happening. Hinton

causing harm has risen in recent times.
""And how manyexamplesdoyouknow of

Amid countless
avenues of
entertainment that
are just a click away,
some festivals are
attempting to keep
the tradition of oral
storytelling alive
GARIMA SADHWANI
FTHERE'S ONE thing that global-
isation has tried to very covertly
take away from us, it's our own
traditions, the ones that we grew
up with and held close to our
hearts for many many ages. Until one
day, we woke up and never indulged in
them again.
One such tradition that has been at
the risk of being lost for quite some time
now is oral storytelling. Remember the
tales your grandmother used to tell you
while tucking you inbed,themagicthat
mushairas held, the Ramayana and
Mahabharata tales recited in your
neighbourhoods, and even the extem-
pore competitions in school where you
invariably fumbled or laughed?
Inatime when countlessavenues of
entertainment are just a click away,
preserving the OGs can be an arduous
task, one that might feel too tedious.
But there are some people who have
held onto them firmly, to keep intact
the glory of an almost pious art
form-one that myths and mytholo-
gies hugely relied on.
Take for instance, story-
telling festivals-Kathaalok
held in Delhi, Gaatha: Mum-
bai International Storytelling
Festival, Kathakar scheduled to
be held in the national capital from
January 31-February 2, Udaipur Tales
to be held in its namesake Rajasthani
city from January 10-12, and Spoken
Fest, among others. Held across
regions, they have been wonderful
avenues to bring patrons of the art
form together.
Says Sushmita Singha,co-founderat
Udaipur Tales: ""We are creating a space
where people can pause, connect, and
truly live the magic of storytelling. The
bond between the storyteller and the
listener is something no digital
medium can replicate, and that is what
draws people to festivals.""
Kathakar will be hosting artists from
Poland, UK, Australia, Mongolia and
Estonia, among other countries; while
and mainstream musicians from the
Hindi film industry. Prarthana
Gahilote, festival director of Kathakar
International Storytellers Festival,
which is in its 14th year and set to host
its 18th edition, says they also curate
special sessions for their festival to
bring in schoolchildren.
Roshan Abbas, the founder of Kom-
mune and festival director of Spoken
Fest, which was held in Shillong on
December 6 last month and is gearing up
for its Mumbai edition on February 1-2,
tells FE that their programming, too, is
""intentionally structured to appeal to
people acrossage groups"". They hold pan-
els showcasing contemporary story-
telling, celebrating classical art forms,
conversations with writers and directors,
and performanceshowcases.
But it's not easy to organise these
festivals year after year. Gahilote of
Kathakar says, ""People across all age
groups are now glued to their gadgets.
It is difficult to hold their attention for
more than a few minutes.""
Singha of Udaipur Tales agrees. She
laments that with people so immersed
in the digital world, they rarely get the
chance to ""experience the emotional
connection of listening to astoryinper-
son"" And when theydo, moreoften than
not, they tend to capture it virtually
rather than be present.
All said & done
Bringing any crowd, especially
young people, to festivals is a task in
itself. So the organisers are now offer-
ing them a plethora of formats to
draw them in and help them discover
new talent,
At Udaipur Tales, for instance, folk
artists, qawwals, dastangos, and even
storytellers from Latin America and
France will be performing.
However, Abbasdoes acknowledge,
""Our digital presence has been instru
mental in engaging younger audiences.
With 82% of our audience between
ages 18 and 35 years, Spoken Fest
invites a lot of mindful millennials and
Gen Z seeking authentic experiences.""
Singha, too, mentions that the
nate in bringing in people from all age
groups to the different events and pan-
els; while also organising some sessions
for children.
Accumulating funds to organise
these festivals is a big hurdle too.
Rachna Gahilote Bisht, Kathakar's fes-
tival organiser, says finding funds is a
cycle you could get stuck in. To bring
people to the festival,you have to hosta
magnitude of international performers
-the production and management
costs of which are a burden to handle,
and if you don't have a specialised
lineup, the crowdswon't come.
With Kathakar travelling to Delhi,
Jodhpur, Chennai and Shimla for its

Airlines are offering
more ways than ever to
get a taste of the
champagne skies, but
how do you get past
the curtain, and when
is it worth the cost?
DEBRA KAMIN
VISIONS OF CHAMPAGNE and lie-flat
seats danced in my head when Azores
Airlines accepted my 500-euro bid to
upgrade my husband and me to business
-class during our kid-free vacation this
past August. But the reality was far less
-cushy: Our seats reclined only a few
inches more than regular coach seats.
There was no screen for TV or movies.
Weateexactly the samemeal theyserved
attheback of the plane.And that bubbly?
Abust,
There are more of us cabin climbers
than ever,and many of usmakethesame
Tookie mistake I did,said Anthony Berk-
lich, thefounder of theluxury New York-
based travel agency Inspired Citizen.
Access to first and business class, once
almost exclusively reserved for big
spendersorasa perk for frequent fliers, is
now open to a growing number of trav-
ellers willing to bid for an upgrade, spend
loyalty points or shell out extra cash.
Two decades ago, Delta Air Lines typ-
ically filled much of its first-class cabin
with high-status frequent fliers.But now,
more than 70% of seats are taken by
eager customers who have paid for the
privilege of sittingupfront, both through
paidupgradesandthe purchase of a full-
pricefare, according to Glen Hauenstein,
the president of Delta, Airlines are
responding to this hunger by expanding
first-class and business-class cabins -
which in turn creates even more oppor-
tunities for upgrades.
But choose wisely: Not all premium
cabinspamper the same, and ""if you don't
have the facts, you absolutely can be
robbed,"" Berklich said. Here are some
tips for making your lie-flat dreams
come true,
Research the routes
The quality-and extravagance-of
your first-class experience is going to
depend on where you're flying to
and from.
That's because ""there's actually two
types of firstclass,"" said Brian Kelly, founder
of the Points Guy, a website dedicated to
maximisingairline and credit-card loyalty
programmes. If you're flying within the
United States you're almost definitely get-
ting a ""domestic first class"" product that
moreclosely resembles some intemational
businessclassor premium economy.
In other words, did you book first class
on Delta from Kennedy Airport to Hous-
ton? You might get a meal with linen, a bit
more legroom and a cocktail before take-
off,but don't expect to be blown away. First
classon Air France from Paris to Kennedy,
however,comes with chauffeur service to
theairport,aconcierge to handle your hug-
gage,amenities like pajamasand Sisley toi-
letries, and yes,champagne.
On carriers like Etihad Airways, Sin-
gapore Aidines and Emirates,a first-class
ticket can unlock three-room suites,
showers and unlimited caviar.
Book in the next lowest class
Being bumped up from seat 47B to 1Ais
next to impossible,said Berklich, because
airlines allowupgradesone tier at a time.
So set yourself up for success by first
booking in business class if you want to
make it to first class, or in premium econ-
omy if you want to move to business.
""That will be much lessexpensive, and
then you can utilisecredit card points or
miles"" to bridge the gap, Berklich said.
Combine cash and credit card points
Points, miles and dollars can be com-
bined to get into first class, as long as you
usethenighttools.Points from credit cards
can be transferred to aidinemileage
can
programmes, often at a one-to-
one ratio. You
combine those miles and
points to book a first-class
award ticket.
The type of plane will be listed in your
ticket confirmation, and a quick Google
search of that plane type and the airline
name will reveal a seatmap.
Reddit threads and forums also offer
plenty of tips about both first-class and
business-class cabins: On Emirates Airbus
A380s, for example, travellerssay the win.

COMBINE BOTH

Websites like Point.me,
Roametravel
and
Pointhound can help you
search for a flight route and
see which airline programmes
will give you the best deal if you
transfer, while Points Path, a free
browser extension, will show you award
poicing alongside cash pricing when you
search for a ticket in Google flights.
Check the seat map
Before you splurge,always peek at the seat-
ingchartforyour aircraft. On some airlines,
including Lufthansa, Emirates and Amer-
ican, you can book first class and still end
up with a neighbour directly next to you.
""You can have a wildlydifferent experience
depending on the plane you're on,""
Kelly said.
the
Boeing 787 Dreamliner,
travellers say seats 9A and
9L have the largest
footwells, making them
attractive for tall passen-
gers seeking extra legroom.
Be patient, but ready
to pounce
How much it costs to upgrade, and
when those prices change, depends ona
lot:route,demand,even how much people
have historically been willing to pay.
So is it better to upgrade when you
book,orwait until the day of your flight?
There's nohardandfastrule,Kellysaid.
Instead, check in on your airlineappevery
few days to see if costs have budged. And
when they do, be prepared to jump at the
offer and to be spoiled for every future
flight. ""You can't unsee what you've seen
when you get to fly in the front of the
plane,"" Kelly said.

We can now observe food cultures

before going to restaurants,they know the

But here's where it gets interesting:
What we're witnessingisn't just the decline
of traditional food tourism; it's the birth of

find in Germany is how the culinary land-
scape has been transformed by the neady
threemillion Turks(both immigrantsand
members of the diaspora) who have been
developing their own food identity there
since the 1960s.
In Lima,chifa (Chinese Peruvian) and
Nikkei (Japanese Peruvian) dishes are

150-year history of Asian immigration.
While tourists flock to the latest New

Stockholm, where restaurants like Jebena

reimagining their cui-

aren't just fusion

this evolution is that it's

can't truly understand how immigrant
communities are reshaping French iden-

can't grasp Singapore's culinary innova

most innovative Italian dish might come
from a chef in Tokyo who never set foot in
Italy but understands the essence of the
cuisine through a global lens. A pop-up in
Toronto might be defining the future of
Mexican street food by incorporating tech-
niques and ingredients that would be
unthinkablein Oaxaca.

after this, and Siraj bowled one

Bumrah acknowledged him
with a raised right hand, Kohli
pounded an imaginary ballonto

over, Kohli ran to Siraj, his hand

to left or right, or closer. He kept
giving athumbs-upsignal from

eroded investor confidence in the
stock market. The timing was per-
fect too. Thedot-com boom was rag-
ing, and Parekh replicated Mehta's
model to drive up stock prices.
His K-10 stocks, including
names like Pentamedia Graphics,
Global Tele-Systems, and HFCL,
were much sought after by fellow
brokers and investors. Stock
prices of scrips like Visualsoft
rose from 625 to *8,448 per
share and Sonata Software
from 90 to 2,150.
Parekh controlled the
entire show from behind
the scenes using benami
accounts, proxytraders, and
loans from various banks,to
orchestrate a huge pump
and dump scheme.
He generated
artificial
demand for
these K-10
stocks
through
circular trading, wherein he along
with his team executed similar sell
orders in the same price
in the same number
at the same time
which spiked
trading volumes.
Gullible retail
investors rushed
to invest in these
stocks seeing the
pumped up
demand in hopes

of windfall gains, but little did they
know that they were falling into a
trap. But then the dot-com bust
cameat the beginning of 2001, and
the bear cartel began hammering
his favouritestocks. The sharp drop
in the shares'valuations prompted
banks, who were holding these
stocks as pledges, to call informore
securities and repayment of loans.
Parekh's most infamous associa
tion was with Madhavpura Mercan-
tile Cooperative Bank (MMCB), from
which he borrowed nearly *800
crore to fund his market operations,
using inflated stock prices as collat-
eral. After the crash, MMCB was left
chutching worthless shares, trigger-
ing a financial crisis, followed by a
payment crisisat major exchanges.
As the market turbulence coin-
cided with the Budget session of
2001, the government was pres-
sured to look into the crash, and sub-
sequently a probe was initiated by
the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (Sebi) and a joint parliamen-
tary committee into Parekh's deal-
ings.Consequently, he was jailed.
Investigations revealed that this
wasn't Parekh's first crime-hewas
also involved in the Canbank Mutual
Fundscam of 1992, wherein various
entities had siphoned off *47 crore.

RENAULT IS PREPARING a strong

In anote on Sunday,Venkataram

Renault India, highlighted the com-
pany's long-term commitment. ""In
2025, Renault India is poised to
embark on a transformative jour-
ney, laying the groundwork for an
exciting future, hestated. He added
that the revamped Triberand Kiger
would be launched later in 2025,
followed by an all-new SUVin 2026.
Renault's market share in India
has fallen significantly in recent
years,dropping to 1% in FY24 from
2% in FY23, according to SIAM
data. By November FY25, its share
dipped below 1%. The lack of
refreshed models and rising com-
petition have been major challenges
for the company.
Currently, Renault's presencein
India's high-growth SUV market is
limited to the Kiger,a compact SUV.
Its other models include the entry-
level hatchback Kwid and the Triber,
a multi-utility vehicle competing
with Maruti Suzuki Ertiga.
Analysts said with theintroduc-
tion of an affordable EV and new
SUVs, Renault aims to reverse its
declining fortunes in India. The
strategic focus on expanding its
portfolio while addressing gaps in
high-demand segments reflects the
brand's renewed efforts to regain
relevance in a dynamic and com-

While RBF platforms cur-

base compared to venture

non-venture-backed startups
and SMEs has made them
indispensable. The model's
appeal lies in its flexibility,
speed, and alignment with

As equity funding gradu-

The MF industry believes
that indexation is not a tax

ing the new rates retrospec-

investor confidence and deter
new investors from entering

said Amfi.
Over the past 3-5 years,

of around 7%, while the infla-

According to sources, the
government may amend the
Finance Act to consider debt
MF units as *securities"" and
not as ""special mutual funds""
so that long-terminvestments
can benefit from the same tax
rate of 12.5% as listed bonds.
Anurag Mittal, head of
fixed income at UTI MF, said
that fixed income as an asset
class has a long way to go in
India, but the bond market
lacks reasonable maturity
and depth. ""That's why it is
important to encourage retail
investors to invest in profes-

said.
Neeraj Agarwala, partner,
Nangia & Co, said, ""While the

'The risk-reward potential looks
better in large-caps at this stage'
In a significant part of the large-
capsector, the valuations have
become reasonable and growth
could surprise on the upside in
FY26. Rahul Singh, chief
investment officer, Equities, Tata
Mutual Fund, in an interview to
Sailcat Neogi underlines that the
expectations on mid- and small-
caps in terms of earnings growth
are on the higher side and could
see disappointment if there are
execution challenges or persistent
macro slowdown.
What kind of asset allocation
strategy should a retail investor
lookatin the new year?
Asset allocation can be 40%
inbalanced/hybrid/multi asset
funds, another 30-40% in core
diversified categories like large-
caps coupledorlargeandmid-
caps and remaining in small cap/
sectoral funds (banking/
healthcare). However, it also
depends on the investor's risk
appetite and goals to be achieved.
Should investors now take a
staggered approach to invest in
select mid-and small-caps?
Mid-andsmall-caps are
trading at premium to largecaps.
Some of that is justified by the
nature of the economic growth
that has been led by the
investment cycle recovery which
benefits the sectors that are
small-cap and mid-cap
dominated. However, the risk-
reward potential seems better in
large-caps at this stage. In a
significant part of thelarge-cap
sectors, the valuations have
become reasonable and growth
could surprise on the upside in
FY26.On the other hand, the
expectations on mid- and small-
caps in terms of earnings growth
are on the higher side and could
seedisappointment if thereare
execution challenges or
persistent macro slowdown.
Even though the capex.cycle
recovery is supportive of small-
and mid-caps, a staggered
approach will reduce the risk
inherent in valuations.
How canbybrid funds offera
balanced investment
approach?
By allocating funds in
equity and debt based on
LONGER DURATION
[FUNDS GILT FUNDS &
CORPORATE BOND
[FUNDS MAY BE
[PREFERRED FOR
UPCOMING RATE CYCLE
equity market valuations, these
funds notonly help manage the
volatility risk but also can take
advantage of that. Also, the
allocation changes are done
based on a formula which
removes the emotion from
that decision.
What are the pockets of
opportunities available now?
Weare currently positive on
the banking and
pharma/healthcare
sectors. The banking
sector is particularly
attractive from a
valuation standpoint,
given that they are
trading ata 35%
discount to the Nifty50,
which is three times
their historical average.
The recent regulatory
actions and the Reserve
Bank of India's hawkish
stance notwithstanding,
weanticipate growth
drivers for banks in 2025.
However, we prefer private
banks over their public sector
undertaking (PSU) peers due to
their superior profitabilityand
historically low valuation gap
compared to thelatter.
In the pharma/healthcare
sector, we see a blend of cyclical
recovery, outsourcing
opportunities, and structural
growth in hospitals and
diagnostics. While valuations,
especially in hospitals and
branded generics, have risen
sharply, we expect earnings
momentum to continue,
supporting these valuations
and delivering compounding
returns. Weremain selective,
concentrating on large-cap
companies with strong
earnings potential.
As debt funds offer stability and
predictable returns, what types
offunds should retail investors
look at now?
Given our view on rates,we
believe investors should increase
the duration and look to invest
inlongerduration funds. Gilt
funds and corporate bond funds
may be preferred for upcoming
rate cycle.
Inflows intothematicfunds
bave cooled in November,
Should investors now take a
cautious approach to invest in
these funds?
Yes. All the themes like
defence, manufacturing, capital
goods, power and real estateare
becoming more stock specific
now, which can be better
addressed through the core
category diversified funds."

partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas
Moving a step closer towards the
implementation of India's maiden
data protection law, the government
has released the draft Digital Personal
Data Protection Rules, 2025, for pub-
lic consultation.
The rules make an eamestattempt to
bring proceduralclacityon somebuilding
blocks like notice to seek consent, consent
managers, retention periods for certain
businesses, certain data principal rights,
and breach notification, but not without
keeping alive concerns around verifiable
parental consent, obligations of signifi-
cant data fiduciaries, exemptions, and
implementation timelines, and reviving
some issues which we had hoped wereput
to rest, such as cross-border data trans-
fers, and use of algorithms.
The long-awaited rules,published fol-
lowing much discussion and inter-min-
istry consultation, will beopen for public
comments for at least 45 days. Once
finalised, certain parts of the rules
(largely, dealing with the Data Protection
BoardorDPB)and corresponding parts of
the DPA, will come into force upon their
publication. The rest of the rules willcome
into forceona laterdate, to be specified in
thefinal rules.
The Rules require that notice for
consent be for specified purposes
through adistinct document that is eas-
ily understandable.This noticemust,at
the least, provide descriptions of per-
sonal data, the specified purpose of pro-
cessing,list goods or services and use
cases to be enabled through processing,
and provide clear means for exercising
data principal rights.
While this emphasis on itemised
details may help transparency and
accountability, it will mean that busi-
nesses have to satisfyademanding rigid,
and expensive consent regime. Given this
background,entities may be well advised
to examine their existing notices, griev-
ance redress and data principal right
mechanisms to meet timelines for imple-
mentation.
Substantial details about qualifica-
tions, functions, and obligationsofcon-
sent managers, who will be a very impor-
tant part of India's new data ecosystem,
have been provided in the rules. Entities
must be incorporated in
India, have a minimum
net worth, and a suitable
technology platform to
apply for registrationasa

ing access control, log reports, deploy-
ment of encryption tools, tokenisation,
masking, and requiring fiduciaries to
contractually obligate processors to
ensure data security.
The rules prescribe a demanding,
""one-size-fits-all"" requirement for
reporting data breaches to the DPB and
data principals, without regard to the
harms resulting from breach. The report-
ing is required to be done promptly and

ting registration, they will
actas ""data blind interme-

principals to grant (or
reject) consents sought by
data fiduciaries who are
onboarded with consent
managers. They are required to act on
behalf of individuals and help exercise
data protection rights, while avoiding
any conflict of interest.Defaults by con-
sent managers could result in cancella-
tion or suspension of registrations, in
addition to thefinesunder theDPA. The
details provided are timely, but kick-

to dependoninteroperabilitystandards

Undedining the importance of imple-

background, businesses
mayneedtorevisit the suf-

measures around report-

the demanding new
requirements.
Another subject for
entities to worry about is
""verifiable consent"" from
parents for processing
children's data. Before
dealing with children's data, entities
must reliably verify age and identity of
parents based on already available data,
ordata provided voluntarily, or through
services of a government authorised
body that maintains virtual tokens
including DigiLocker service providers.
This seems to come with an added due
diligence obligation to vet the authen-
ticity of the data provided for verifica-
tion purposes, which maybe financially
onerous, especially for small entities.
Significant data fiduciaries, to be
identified by officers who will be
appointed for this purpose, are required
to meet much higher requirements.
These include annual impact assess-
ments and audits, with key findings
going to the DPB.
Much more concerningly, the rules
seem to risk reviving two key concerns
which many had felt were put to rest. For
significant fiduciaries, the government
may require identified data to be keptin
India. The rules also provide for addi-
tional rules to bespecified for all entities
inrelation to cross-border data transfers.
These (currently open-ended) require-
ments can have a mammoth impacton
the operations of several platforms. Per-
haps even more concerningly, the rules
also prescribe open-ended ""additional
due diligence"" fortheuse of ""algorithmic
software""by significant data fiduciaries.
Greater clarity on each of the above,
during the consultation process on the
rules, will be very helpful.
The releaseofthedraft rulesmarksan
important step towards recognising,
enforcing, and strengthening data pro-
tection norms in India. Where retained
asis, they could potentially present hur-
dles for implementation, require busi-
nesses to make expensive adjustments,
and may also result in consent fatiguefor
data principals. Given this background,
effective public consultation and dia-
logue is critical, and businesses should
use the period leading up to implemen-
tation of the rules wisely, both to provide
their comments and to prepare for the
implementation of the final rules."

O FROM PLATE TO PLOUGH
2025 OFFERS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY POLITICALLY FOR THE MODI GOVT TO OVERHAUL THE SYSTEM
Reform agriculture
ET ME START by wishing read-
ers of this column a very
happy, peaceful, and prosper-
ous new year.
What could I wish for Indian agricul-
ture, a subject that has been my lifelong
passion and commitment? Mydream
would be to see vibrant and sustainable
agriculture which is climate-resilient,
increases productivity, brings prosper-
ity to peasants, and, above all, improves
the real wages of farm workers who are
literally at the bottom of the economic
Pyramid. It is only by raising productiv-
ity that India can rein in food inflation,
which hasbeen playing spoilsport lately.
Vegetable inflation, at 29% (and potato
inflation of 67%) in November 2024,
has humbled the Reserve Bank of India
(RBI), notallowing it to reduce the repo
rate. That is simply tragic.
The India Meteorological Depart-
ment has made it clear that 2024 was
the warmest year since 1901, and the
temperatures were 0.9°C higher in
2024 than the long period average.
Earlier studies by scientists of the
Indian Council of Agricultural
Research predicted that an increase in
temperature by 1°C ran the risk of
reducing wheat output by 5%. Wheat
is likely to be the most impacted by
heat spikes in February when grain for-
mation is taking place.
Although the Prime Minister
released 109 varieties of various crops
(including wheat) that are supposed to
be climate-resilient, the challenge of
taking them from the scientists' labs to
farmlands remains daunting. This is
because the government's agri-exten-
sion network is the weakest link in the
production system.
Agri-R&D as well as agri-extension
need a major boost in the coming Bud-
get if Indian agriculture is to be climate-
resilient. Inthiscontext, it may benoted
ASHOK GULATI
Distinguished professor, ICRIER
thatin the last three years or so, there is
awide gap in the governmentestimates
of wheat production and what the pri-
vate trade believes. No wonder wheat
prices have been under pressure, and
government stocks meagre. The govern-
ment is trying to supress prices by
releasing wheat at about $2,300/quin-
tal in the open market operations, while
the minimum support price for the
forthcoming season is €2,450/quintal,
and the economic cost to the Food Cor-
poration of India is about
€2,800/quintal. This is
simply dumping and
anti-farmer.

into Viksit Bharat by

achieved unless farmers'

Supreme Court step in to
bring some order among
political parties on elec-

democracy? Most of these are a waste of
taxpayers' money, who feel helpless and

Coming back to reforming agricul-

ment at the Centre, 2025 seems a
golden chance as the parliamentary
elections are far away. The big expen-
ditures in rural areas, including agri-
culture, are going from the central

cross *5 lakh crore out of a Budget of
about *45 lakh crore (FY25). All these
need to be rationalised, and one can
easily save at least 1 lakh crore that
canbeinvested backin agriculture and
rural areas for building basic infra-
structure, ranging from roads and
water harvesting to upgrading agri-
mandis and rural haats.
But how do we rationalise these
mega subsidies and so-called welfare
programmes? The fertiliser subsidy
needs to be merged with PM-Kisan and
given to farmers directly on a per
hectare basis, while fertiliser prices
need to be deregulated and freed.
Micro-managing prices for each urea
plant, and then informally controlling
even di-ammonium phosphate prices,
when in theory they are relatively free,
is reminiscent of the socialistera of the
USSR. The timidity of successive gov.
ernments is reflected in the fact that
urea prices have not been revised since
2012, while all other commodity prices
have gradually risen. This is not helping
either the peasantry, productivity, or
the planet, as it is leading to inefficient
use and massive diversions.
Similarly, food subsidy must be tar-
geted and given in the form of digital
coupons to be spent on, say, 20 nutri-
tious food items. The MGNREGA needs
to be dovetailed with agri-work and PM
Awas Yojana. The whole system needs an
overhaul.It can bedone if the Modi gov.
ernment is bold and remains focused.
Else, I am afraid, India will keep limping
with occasional falls and injuries in its
race to Viksit Bharatby 2047.

IT'S WINTER TIME but pollution
levels are still high due to a combi-
nation of atmospheric and human
factors. But most air purifiers exac-
erbate the winter chill by pushing
out cool drafts along with clean air.
This is where a product like the
Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 can
make a difference, keeping the
room air clean and pleasant at the
same time, It has the trademark
design from the UK tech company
with a loop-shaped bladeless fan
that throws out the cleaned air
sucked in by the filters at the base,
On the front, there is an LED dis-
play that gives you a lot of informa
tion, from present PM2.5 and PM10
levels to the trend line showing an
improvement in air quality as the
purifier runs. You can also see the
temperature of the heater as well as
some animations illustrating how
the filterworks.
Butthere is just the power button
onthepurifier, which means you will
need to use the remote for all con-
trols. The remote, as with other
Dyson units, attaches magnetically
to the top of the fan loop. On the
remote, you have theoption to adjust
the fan speed, increase the tempera-
ture upto 37 degrees Celsius, choose
autoorsleep mode,and makethefan

However, there is a catch here
compared to other Dyson air puri-
fiers I have used. While this Puri-
fier Hot+Cool Gen 1 can be added
to the MyDyson app like other
units, I could not see any control
panel for the same. The app just
shows how-tos and FAQs about
the device and lets you buy a new
set of filters but does not let you
control it. This means you have to
be careful about the small remote
that comes in the box,

is distributed across the room, the

IN THE END, just one Indian

Jasprit Bumrah,thecaptain and
theman of the series.
Even the man on whom the

had deemed that Sunil

BGT. Somewhat apt end to a
dramatic, but chaotic tour.
Theseries had started with a
question of what would happen
if something happens to Bum-

had notonlydecided to immor-
talise himself into the imagina-

the most enthralling string of
performances through the
series, but also managed to
inspire the rest of the bowling

very fallible batting unit of Aus-
tralia,India had somehowhung
on till what would be the final
day of the series with a chance to
retain the BGT.
On what tumed out to bethe
final day that dreaded question
was answered and India sans
Bumrah couldn't produce that
mini-miracle needed to defend

that more than Australia, India
needs to do. Rohit Sharma's best

how youngsters aren't still

increase in product exports
towards West Asia, likely due to
increased refinery maintenance in
the region, Tang said.
India primarily supplies petro-
leum products to countries in
Europe and Asia. The country has
emerged as a major fuel supplier to
Europe in the past fewmonths after
European countries started boy-
cotting Russian supplies post its
invasion of Ukraine.
The exports to West Asia
increased by 52% to 278,155 bar-
rels per day in Decembercompared
to the previous month.
Union minister for petroleum
and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri
on multiple events has said that
there is no shortage of oil in the
market but if there are geopolitical
tensions, it may increase the cost of
freightforshippers.
The country exports a variety of
goods via the Red Sea including
petroleum products. However, the
traffic diversion from the Red Sea
and around the Cape of Good Hope
owing to geopolitical tensions over
the region has added 10 days to
Asia-Europe journeys while also
increasing fuel costs, the govern
menthadearlier said.
Meanwhile, the domestic con-
sumption of petroleum products in
April-November increased to 157.5
million tonne from 152.4 million
tonne in the same period in FY24,
according to data from the petro-
leumplanning and analysiscell. The
growth is majorly driven by arise in
demand for diesel, aviation turbine
fuel, and liquefied petroleum gas.
The country's demand for petro
leum products, including jet fuel
diesel and LPG, is likely to grow to 239
million tonne in FY25, as per esti-
mates by the petroleum planning
and analysis cell. The country's con
sumption of petroleum products
stood at 233 million tonne last year."

TELECOM OPERATORS SUCH as

The operators are expected to
include this request in their com

draft rules for implementing the
Act, which were released last week.
The extended timeline is being
sought to allow telecom operators
to modify their customer applica-

existing technological frameworks
to manage user consent regarding
data usage and processing.
Given the massive volumes of
personal data handled by telecom
operators, they are expected to be
classified as significant data fidu-
ciaries under the DPDP Act.
Currently, telcosutilise personal
data for sending marketing mes-
sages, making sales pitches, and
generating app-based offers. They
also share data with third parties in
bundled services, such as offering

user consent and the implementa

operational changes.
In a bid to ensure verifiable
parental consent to manage data of
minors, the telecom operators are
expected to make changes to their
CAFs, which would require parents
to declare that SIM card is being
taken for a child.
""Obtaining explicit consent for

Telecom operators will also have
to ensure mechanisms to manage

which will be particularlychallenging
given their large customer base.Non-

of up to 250 crore, imposed by the

An executive at a telecom firm
said they are not much concerned
about verifiable parental consentas
the SIM cards are taken by people
above 18.
Besides, if a minor would use
SIM cards on parents' ID, then it will
automatically be from the consent
of parents. In the CAF, a column or
two can be added asking people if
they are taking sim cards for them-
selves or for minors.
Sucharita Basu, managing part-

FRÉDÉRIC BASTIAT ONCE remarked,
""Goverment is the great fiction through
whicheverybodyendeavours to liveatthe
expense of everybody else."" Nowhere is
this fiction more evident than in India's
sub-national public finance, where the
illusion of infinite resources drives
chronic overspending, mounting debts,
and politicalshort-terism.Sub-national
fiscal responsibility legislations (FRLs)
were introduced to imposediscipline, but
theirdesign and enforcementvary widely
across states, reflecting a troubling lack of
uniformity. While some states adhereto
stringent rules and demonstrate fiscal
prudence, others exploit loopholes or
ignore long-term consequences in
favour of immediate political gains. This
stark variation, coupled with economic
mismanagement, creates a dangerous
cocktail of fiscal instability. Without
consistent standards and stronger
accountability, India risks plunging into
a fiscal disaster where one state's
excessescould spill over and undermine
the nation's economicfoundation.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its
latest State Finances Report,has reviewed
sub-national FRLs,and the reportisworth
a read.Fiscal transparency is a comerstone
of good governance. Whilethe Uniongov-
ernment has made significantstrides in
fiscal transparency, state governments
have also adopted measures to enhance
their fiscal disclosures. Key principles

uments like ""Budgetata Glance"" and dis-

Madhya Pradesh,Odisha, and Rajasthan
-have legislated the actuarial disclosure
of pension liabilities for the next decade,

data, such as contingent liabilities and off-
budget borrowings,remainschallenging.

actual receipts and expen-

a three-year period.
The PEFA scores across 20 major
Indian states highlight systemic issuesin
budgeting accuracy, particularly in rev-
enue receipts. During period I(2016-17
to 2018-19), states such as Jharkhand,

decline underscores weaknesses in fiscal

components like state goods and services
The PEFA scores for revenue expendi-

from Budgetestimates across key sectors.

development, no state
secured an ""A""or""B"" in period II,reflecting
systemic inefficiencies in planning and
execution. Further, given the freebies
being doled out across states, the fiscal
marksmanship under this categorymight
deteriorate in the future.
The PEFA scores for capital expendi-
ture across Indian states reveal a sharp
decline in fiscal marksmanship, with
fewer states achieving crediblescores in
period II compared to period I. While
states like Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh,
and Odishaachieved ""A""in period,only
Tharkhand and Telangana achieved it in

falling to the lowest ""D""category surged
to 13.Sectors such as urban develop-
ment, irrigation, transport, and water
supply saw widespread deterioration,
with states like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar,
and Maharashtra consistently scoring
""D"". Even traditionally stable sectors like
medical and public health failed to
secure meaningful improvements.
While the Covid-19 pandemic undeni-
ably disrupted fiscal planning and exe-
cution, the toll on capital expenditure
reflects deeper structural weaknesses,
including poor programme manage-
ment and prioritising fiscal rule compli-
ance over long-term investment. This
persistent underperformance under-
scores the inability of states to effec-
tively plan and execute capital budgets,
compromising critical infrastructure
development across the board. The
underperformance in capital expendi-
ture is particularly conceming, given its
significantly higher economic multi-
plier than revenue expenditure,
To address the persistent gapsinstate-
level budgeting and fiscal marksmanship,
there must be stronger incentives for
states to improve theirfiscal planning and
bring off-budgetborrowings into thefor-

mission could play a pivotal role by link-
ing grants and allocations to improved
Budgetreliability,better fiscal disclosures,
and adherence to FRL, By tying these
grants to measurable reforms, states
would have a tangible incentive to en-

including in India.
Many trade treaties and agreements,
in addition to facilitating trade, have
begun incorporating provisions for the
cross-border movement of legal person-
nel. The General Agreement on Trade in
Services of 1995 includes provisions for
themovement of services, including legal.
Similarly, several regional agreements
have established frameworks to support
this, such as the North American Free
Trade Agreement (1994), the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
Framework Agreement on Services
(1995), the Comprehensive Economicand
Trade Agreement between Canada and
the European Union (2016),etc.
However, these treaties allow for the
cross-border movement of legal person-
nel only on a temporary basis and under
regulatory oversight. Amid the near-total
unification of markets, the EU stands out
in this regard. The EU introduced the
Lawyers' Establishment Directive (Direc-
tive 98/5/EC) to encourage greater inte-
gration of the union's legal market.
In India, the issue of cross-border
movement of legal personnel arose
through litigation. It was alleged that cer-
tain foreign law firms had established
offices in India in an unauthorised man-
ner. This was challenged in the Bombay
and Madras High Courts. Ultimately, the
case reached the Supreme Court of India,
which passed a judgment in 2018 stating
that only advocates enrolled under the
provisions of the Advocates Act, 1961,are
permitted to ""practise"" Law in India.
Nevertheless, the count permitted for-
eign lawyers to make ""casual visits"" to

FOR YEARS, THE 916-billion
Indian marketing industry has
relied on anabundance of personal
data to craft targeted campaigns,
often without explicit user con-
sent. Clearly, there was significant
disconnect between consumers
and their personal data and how
the companies that collect it,useit.
The proposed Digital Personal Data
Protection (DPDP) Rules have the
capacity to disrupt this framework,
handing the lever to the consumer.
""Brands must now focus on creat-
ing value exchanges where con-
sumers willingly share data
because they see tangible benefits,
not just because they have no other
choice,"" says Surendra Singh, CEO,
Brand Street Integrated.
The push for stringent datapro-
tection laws mirrors global trends
akin to European Union's General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
that protects the privacy and secu-
rity of personal data. ""While laws
exist, the real challenge is not just
their creation but how well theyare
implemented and enforced,"" says
Chandan Bagwe, founder & direc-
tor of CCom Digital.
Time to rebuild trust
The overwhelming consensus
among marketers is that the
DPDP Act and Rules will not only
reshape how individual brands
communicate with their con-
sumers but will challenge the
broader advertising ecosystem. To
start with, the Rules mandate a
shift from implied consent to
explicit opt-ins. Pre-checked
boxes and vague consent mecha-
nisms will be things of the past. By
prioritising user privacy and gran
ular consent, it will encourage
marketers to focus on genuine
leads. ""Marketers and advertisers
are far more likely to rely on intel-

Contextual advertising will
probably bea bigger deal now than
hyper-personalisation. In other
words, there could be a consider-
able shift away from targeting
customers based on their profiles
and instead focus on what they are
already searching for or consum
ing online.
Additionally, withdrawing
consent must be as seamless as
granting it. That will force brands
to redraw the line between pri-
vacy and commerce.""Marketers
thrive on data to achieve maxi-
mum reach. The proposed DPDP
Rules will require the industry to
adapt by fine-tuning and updat-
ing their systems,"" notes Raj
Ramachandran, partner at JSA
Advocates & Solicitors.
Seemingly straightforward
forms that collect basic informa-
tion, such as names and email
addresses, will fall under the Act's
purview. Once collected, con-

stated purpose. It cannot be
shared without consent and
must be deleted after three years.
""Thatadds another layer of oper-
ational complexity,"" says Chan-
dan Bagwe,founder & director of
C Com Digital.
Not just complexity, for mar-
keters, these requirements trans-
late into additional costs. The cost
of stooing information, maintain-
ing inventory across systems like
email, WhatsApp, and websites,
and categorising it accurately is
significant. Even the deletion
process requires either automa-
tion or manual intervention,
which incurs additional expenses.
""Security, throughoutthelifecycle
of the data, will be paramount,""
says Bagwe.
The financial burden aside, the
Act will trigger marketers to think
out of the box. It will prompt busi-
nessesto prioritisefirst-party data,
leveraging loyalty programmes
and direct customer engagement
over third-party data. This shift
could level the playing field for
smaller firms, allowing them to
compete through meaningful cus-
tomer relationships rather than
sheer data volume. A comprehen-
sive ground-up approach will lay
the foundation for effective long-
term compliance, adds Mayuran
Palanisamy, partner, Deloitte India.
Ambika Sharma, founder &
chief strategist, Pulp Strategy,says
whilesmall businesses mightface
some early hurdles in the form of
high compliance cost, in the long
run, these regulations will foster
trust. ""This shift will compel
brands to build deeper relation-
ships with consumers by focusing
on transparency and offering gen-
uine value,"" she says.
Going forward, brands must
align with what Hemal Majithia,
founder, Oktomind,refersto as the
CARE framework of communica-
tion - comprising clarity,
accountability, relevance, and
engagement. ""Marketers can no
longer rely on vague consent or
indefinite data retention. The
DPDP Act asks us to clearly com-
municate why we're collecting
data, how long we'll store it, and
how it benefits the user. This isn't
just compliance; it's about foster-
ing trust,"" he asserts. The three-
year data retention limit will push
them to focus on the value of expe-
riences and products, which ulti-
mately builds deeper customer
trust, sums up Pathik Patel,

Against the backdrop of

and negotiations are mak-

sources in the know.
The Stryker, manufac-

A CIVILIAN truck driver was
killed in a firing incident involv-

Srinagar-Jammu national high-

While the Army claims he
jumped a checkpoint and was
chased for 23 km before tyres of
the truck were fired at ""to de-

up a storm after his family and
political leaders questioned the
official version,
A civilian truck driver was
killed when the army fired at him
near Sopore's Sangrama on the
Srinagar-Baramulla highway,po-
lice said, Police identified the the
driver as Waseem Ahmad Mir
(32), a resident of Bomai village,
which is some 15 km from
Sangrama, the site of the shooting
This comes at a time when
the district administration and
police in Kathua ordered in-
quiries after the custodial death
of a Gujjar youth in Kathua,
In its statement after the
truck driver's killing, the army's
Chinar Corps said the driver
jumped a check post Wednesday
when he was asked to stop. ""On
Feb 5, 2025, based on a specific
intelligence input about the
movement of terrorists, a Mobile
Vehicle Check Post (MVCP) was

to halt at Sangrama Chowk.... the
injured driver was immediately
evacuated to GMC Baramulla by
Security Forces where he was
declared dead.""
But the family of the driver
questioned the army's version
and demanded the release of
CCTV footage of the incident,
Significantly, there are several
security camps and security
check posts on the stretch. As per
Mir's cousin Abdul Rashid, Mir
had left home at 10 pm
Wednesday with a truck full of
apple boxes and was heading to-
wards Srinagar, It was a co-driver
who alerted them of Mir's death.
""If the army is telling the truth,
let them share the CCTV footage
with us... installed on every secu-
rity force vehicle,"" Mir's cousin
Abdul Rashid told The Indian
Express. ""They (army) are saying
they chased him for 23 km. There
are many (security) camps on this
stretch and every camp has CCTV
cameras installed on the roads...
Let them show it...""
He claimed there were ""con-
tradictions in the statements
made by the police and the army"".
""How could they chase him
for 23 km when the distance be-
tween his home and the place
where the incident happened is
less than 16 km... the SP sahib said
he was chased for 35 km... when
he had to go to Srinagar, why was
the vehicle in the (opposite) di-
rection, going to Baramulla. His
clothes were in the dirt. We want
to know if they had beaten...him

Hospital said Mir was brought in
by the Army at 1 pm and ""had a

and exit wounds...suggested that
he was shot at from close range,""
Another relative said, ""The
bullet hit his armpit and exited
from the other side. If the army
had aimed at the tyres...the bul-
let couldn't have hit his armpit.""
The oldest of four siblings, Mir
is survived by his father, mother,
three brothers and a sister.
Meanwhile, opposition par-
ties have called the incident a
""disregard for Kashmiri lives"".
The Peoples Democratic Party
(PDP) leader Iltija Mufti has also
questioned the Army's version.
""you (army)say that you chased

Mansarovar Yatra, the two statements al-
most echo each other, but the Chinese state-
ment reflects more urgency,
The Indian statement said the two sides
""decided to resume the Kailash Mansarovar
Yatra in the summer of 2025; the relevant
mechanism will discuss the modalities for
doing so as per existing agreements"". The
Chinese statement concurred, adding that
the two sides ""will discuss relevant arrange-
ments as soon as possible.""
DIRECT FLIGHTS: As many as 539
scheduled direct flights, with a cumulative
capacity of more than 1.25 lakh passengers,
operated between India and China each
month, as of 2019, They were paused dur-
ing the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, And fol-
lowing the Galwan clash in June that year,
they never resumed.
On this issue, a careful reading of the two
statements shows that while Delhi wants a
new pact, China has linked this to visas and
resident journalists.
The Indian statement said: ""They agreed
in principle to resume direct air services be-
tween the two countries; the relevant tech-
nical authorities on the two sides will meet
and negotiate an updated framework for
this purpose at an early date"".
China said: ""The two sides agreed to re-
sume direct flights between Chinese main-
land and India, support the competent au-
thorities of the two countries to coordinate
and push it forward, and take measures to
facilitate personnel flows and exchanges of
resident journalists"",
Currently, there is only one Indian resi-
dent journalist in China. There is no Chinese
journalist in India.
TRANS-BORDER RIVERS: On trans-
border rivers like the Brahmaputra, both
sides agreed to hold an early meeting of the
India-China Expert Level Mechanism. This
will involve sharing of data, which has been
an issue in recent times.
Beijing in December cleared the construc-
tion of the world's largest dam on the Tsangpo
(Siang or Brahmaputra in India) close to the
Indian border, triggering worries in the lower
riparian states of India and Bangladesh.
New Delhi said it was not informed by
the Chinese side about the dam project,
something that has long been the conven-
tion between the two countries, and learnt
of it from media reports, Indian officials
then reached out to their Chinese counter-
parts about sharing information in advance,
and consulting India and Bangladesh,
Regularmeetings and information sharing
at the level of an expert-level mechanism -
like the one both sides have agreed to hold soon
-can prevent such situations in the future.
Notable silences
One of the two countries was silent on
some key issues.
On trade, the Indian side spelt out its con-
cerns on market access and tariff barriers.
""Specific concerns in the economic and trade
areas were discussed with a view to resolv-
ing these issues and promoting long-term
policy transparency and predictability,"" New
Delhi's statement said. The Chinese state-
ment makes no mention of this.
Conversely, on SCO, China said: ""The
Indian side will extend full support for
Chinese presidency of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization, and will actively
participate in the meetings under the SCO
umbrella."" India makes no mention of this,

Greece's Foreign Minister
Giorgos Gerapetritis who
will hold Foreign Office
consultations, and Egyp-
tian Foreign Minister Badr
Abdelatty for a strategic
dialogue with Mr. Jaishan-

will visit a few weeks after
the Gaza ceasefire and the
reopening of the Rafah
border crossing from
Egypt to Gaza, is expected
to share his views on the
reconstruction of Gaza
during his visit to India.
Prime Minister Naren-

to discuss the IMEC project
with French President Em-

to France for the Artificial
Intelligence Summit bet-
ween February 10 and 12,
and with new U.S. Presi-
dent Donald Trump during
a visit to Washington that is
still being planned.
Official and diplomatic
sources said that while no
specific moves on the pro-
ject were being discussed
at present, hopes for a sta-

Gaza and the region had
grown in the past few

Screenshot 2025-02-10 143527.png	"Four years on, Myanmar and its continuing nightmare
our years after the military coup on
February 1, 2021, Myanmar, 'the sick man
dismal path. The nation is fragmenting; there is
no peace and stability; the economy is in ruins;
the people are suffering; and the international
community has other headaches to worry about.
Myanmar's deepening crisis has been forgotten or
ignored by most nations, except perhaps the
member-states of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and neighbours such as
China and India.
A stocktaking
The past four years have brought armed battles to
homes, villages, and cities, with government
troops fighting against their own people,
represented by a variety of ethnic armed
organisations (EAOs) and people's defence forces
(PDFs) in all parts of the country-north, south,
east and west, not excluding the heartland where
the majority Bamar community lives. The
resistance is broadly coordinated by the
unrecognised National Unity Government (NUG).
The costs of conflict are high. The Assistance
Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP)
estimated that, as of January 29, 2025, the
military arrested 28,405 people, of whom 21,683
were still detained, and that it killed 6,224 people
with around 2,900 treated as ""need to be verified
killed persons."" Besides, over 3.3 million people
are now internally displaced across the country.
Independent sources have spoken of
""indiscriminate attacks"" and ""unlawful killings""
by the junta that are ""characterized by their
brutality and inhumanity."" It should also be
recognised that four years of continuous fighting
have done untold damage to military personnel,
resulting in killings, injuries, desertions, and a
general loss of morale. ""The junta is entering the
fifth year of military rule,"" wrote Professor
Zachary M. Abuza of the National War College,
Rajiv Bhatia
is a Distinguished
Fellow at Gateway
House, a former
Ambassador of India
to Myanmar, and the
author of
'India-Myanmar
Relations: Changing
Contours'
The deepening
crisis in the
country seems
to have been
forgotten or
ignored by most
nations;
Myanmar
is fragmenting
Washington DC, ""with its power rapidly slipping
away"". The junta forces and the resistance are
thus locked in a ceaseless war of attrition in
which neither side can be a victor.
Meanwhile, the country stands divided into
three zones. The central part remains broadly
under military control. Peripheral areas are
generally with the resistance. Armed battles with,
and aerial bombardments by, the military occur
in civilian regions located in both zones. Inner
demons continue to haunt the people of
Myanmar.
ASEAN's role
The crisis began in early 2021 when the military
did not like the results of the elections held in
November 2020 that gave Aung San Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy victory. The
10-year-old experiment in limited democracy was
rudely terminated as tanks rolled into the streets.
Now, to end the impasse, the military's
preferred way out ironically is to hold another
election. The generals tried to do this last year,
but they failed. The question is, can they succeed
this year? With at least half the country outside
their control, elections, if held, will not represent
the views of the entire populace. Besides, if they
are organised under the present conditions of
continuing violence and suppression, will they
confer legitimacy on the next government that
must necessarily be friendly to the military?
Doubts exist.
Notably, United Nations experts led by Tom
Andrews, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation
of human rights in Myanmar, offered a forthright
view. ""You cannot hold an election when you
deposed a democratic government in an
unconstitutional coup and continue to arbitrarily
arrest, detain, disappear, torture, and execute
opposition leaders,"" they warn. The notion that
elections will resolve the political crisis is
considered ""delusional"" by seasoned observers.
However, the UN has outsourced the
responsibility of mediation to ASEAN. ASEAN did
what it could, but its Five-Point Consensus (5PC)
remains stillborn because the cessation of
hostilities and the commencement of national
dialogue are unacceptable to the warring parties.
Recently, ASEAN Foreign Ministers advised the
military government to prioritise dialogue over
holding elections, but this has been brushed
aside.
The neighbours in the picture
The UN and ASEAN are unable to resolve matters
for Myanmar. In that case, some experts argue
that the nation's neighbours, China, India,
Thailand, Bangladesh, and Laos, must do
something tangible, considering that the ongoing
crisis directly threatens their interests.
But there are challenges: Myanmar's borders
with India and Bangladesh are now controlled by
EAOS, not the government; there is a lack of trust
between India and China; and India-Bangladesh
relations are under serious stress. Therefore, the
neighbours are unable to develop an internal
consensus on how to persuade the government
and opposition to move from conflict to peace.
Thailand, the only big neighbour and an ASEAN
member, is uniquely positioned to help, but it
faces limitations that it cannot overcome.
Meanwhile, China has substantially increased
its influence since the coup. It will continue to be
a dominant player, especially as the West shows
declining interest in Myanmar. China is ""the only
outside power with the means, capacity, and
motivation to influence in Myanmar's internal
conflicts,"" wrote Bertil Lintner recently.
Hence, the inescapable conclusion is that the
people of Myanmar should stop hoping that help
will come from the outside. If their leaders are
unable to talk rather than let their guns do the
talking, sadly, they, the people, will continue
paying a hefty price for their leaders' folly."

For a foreign correspon-
dent in Mali, the assign-
ment seemed like a dream:
as Islamic extremists
upended the region, Oli-
vier Dubois, a French jour-
nalist, secured a rare inter-
view with a leader of JNIM,
an al-Qaida's affiliate in the
Sahel.
Or so he thought. En
route to the interview in
Gao, northern Mali, in
April 2021, Mr. Dubois, a
correspondent for Libéra-
tion and Jeune Afrique pu-
blications, was kidnapped.
He spent 711 days in des-

chained to a tree, eating
dried goat meat and plot
ting his escape. Nearly two
years after his release, he
recounts his ordeal in a
book released Thursday in
France.

that helped me resist and
survive was telling myself

The Sahel countries of

Upon
release,
French media published
an investigation revealing
that Mr. Dubois's fixer had
worked with French intelli-
gence, who used him to lo-
cate the extremist leader
he was trying to interview.
Mr. Dubois said he knew
his project was risky, but
that he trusted his fixer too
much and ignored the
warning signs.
""I'm not sure,"" he said
of the circumstances sur-
rounding his kidnapping.
""I think it was a betrayal.
But the motive is not yet
clear.""
Kidnappings have sky-
rocketed in the Sahel in re-
cent years, according to
data from the U.S.-based
Armed Conflict Location &
Event Data Project, or
ACLED.
JNIM, the Sahelian
branch of al-Qaida, has
been responsible for most
of the 1,468 kidnappings in
Sahel and Benin between
2017 and 2025, according
to the ACLED. The group
relies on ransom money to
fund their operations and
on the fear they instill on
local populations to keep
them in check.
Mr. Dubois recalled be-

instructed. Mr. Dubois was
released on March 20,

which translates in English
into Prisoner of the desert,
711 days in the hands of Al-

he was hoping he was rea-
dy to go back to journalism
and move on.
'Painful labour'
But the experience still
haunts him. ""It was painful
labour,"" he said of the writ-
ing process. ""The first re-

Hayan Hadid was 18 when
soldiers arrested him in his
pyjamas and took him for
execution in Syria's Hama
in 1982, during one of the
darkest chapters of the As-
sad clan's rule.
""I've never really talked
about that, it was a secret.
Only my family knew,"" said
Mr. Hadid.
In light of the December
8 ouster of Bashar al-Assad,
""we can talk at last"", he
said.
On February 2, 1982,
amid an information black
out, Assad's father and
then leader Hafez
launched a crackdown in
Hama in central Syria
against an armed Muslim
Brotherhood revolt.
The banned movement
had tried two years earlier
to assassinate Hafez, and
his brother Rifaat was
tasked with crushing the
uprising in its epicentre.
No one spared
Survivors who witnessed
extra-judicial executions
said that the crackdown
spared no one, with go-
vernment forces killing
men, women and children.
The death toll of the 27
days of violence has never
been formally established,
though estimates range
from 10,000 to 40,000,
with some even higher.
""I had no ties with the
Muslim Brotherhood, I was
at school,"" said Mr. Hadid,
now in his sixties.
But ""my father was al-
ways very afraid for me
and my brother"", he said.
Mr. Hadid's cousin Mar-
wan had been an influen-
tial figure in the Fighting
Vanguard, an armed off-
shoot of the Brotherhood.
Afteer days of battles,
soldiers turned up in Mr.
Hadid's neighbourhood
and arrested around 200
men, taking them to a
school.
When night fell, around
40 were called by name
and forced into trucks,
their hands tied behind
their backs, he said.

Hama crackdown, at his home in Hama, on Monday. AFP
When the vehicles
stopped, he realised they
were at a cemetery.
""""That means they are
going to shoot us*,"" said the
person next to him.
Blinded by the truck
lights as he stood among
rows of men for execution,
Hadid said he felt a bullet
zip past his head.
""I dropped to the
ground and didn't move... I
don't know how, it was an
instinctive way to try to es-
cape death,"" he said.
A soldier opened fire
again, and Mr. Hadid heard
a wounded man say,
""please, kill me"", before
more shooting.
Miraculously, Mr. Hadid
survived. When the sol-
diers left, he got up and set
off, crossing the Orontes
River before arriving at his
uncle's house.
Forty-three years later,
Bashar al-Assad's ouster
opened the way to gather-
ing testimonies and comb-

security services.
In 1982, Camellia Bou-

hospital service, managing
admissions.
""The bodies arrived by
truck and were thrown in
front of the morgue. Dead,
dead, and more dead. We
were overwhelmed,"" said
Ms. Boutros, now an actor.
Bodies bearing identity
cards were registered by
name, while others were
recorded as ""unknown""
and classified by neigh
bourhood, she said.
Mr. Boutros said the toll
was ""7,000 soldiers,
around 5,000 Muslim
Brotherhood"" members,
and some 32,000 civilians.
The Brotherhood is a
conservative Sunni Muslim
organisation with a pre-
sence around the region,
while the Assads, who
stem from the minority
Alawite community, pur-

Petitioner alleged the clips establish CM Biren Singh's role in ethnic violence
EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE
NEW DELHI, FEBRUARY 3
THE SUPREME Court Monday
sought a sealed-cover report
from the Central Forensic
Sciences Laboratory, which is ex-
amining the “leaked audio
tapes"" that, according to a Kuki
body, established Manipur CMN
Biren Singh's role in fuelling eth-
nic conflict in the state.
A bench of Chief Justice of
India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice
Sanjay Kumar directed Solicitor
General Tushar Mehta, who
appeared for Manipur, that the
report be produced before it on
the next date of hearing on
March 24.
The petitioner, Kuki
Organization for Human Rights
Trust, has sought an independ-
ent investigation based on the
tapes into Biren's alleged role in
the violence, which has killed
more than 200 people in
Manipur since last May. The
Manipur government has
termed the clips as fake and said
that they were released on social
media in an attempt to derail
peace initiatives.
""It is pointed out that audio
clips have been sent for exami-
nation by the CFSL, The report
would be produced in sealed
cover before the court on the
next date of hearing,"" the court
directed.
At the very outset, CJI Khanna
told advocate Prashant Bhushan,
who appeared for the petitioner,
""There are two things. One-the
state is gradually limping back to
normalcy. We will keep it on
hold. The second issue is
whether we should entertain it
or the High Court should enter-
tain it.""
Bhushan said the transcripts
of the tapes were ""very serious""
and implicated the CM. The CJI
said he had not gone through the the petition was filed in
transcripts,
Bhushan said the petitioner
had sent the tapes to Truth Labs
which has ""far more expertise
and credibility than CFSL..."" and
that the lab had said it was ""his
(Biren's) voice"" in the tapes.
SG Mehta pointed out that
Truth Labs was run by private in-
dividuals. He said the ""petitioner
has some ideological inclina-
tions"" and that the court-ap-
pointed committee of former
judges has filed reports saying
""these civil society organisations
are wanting to keep the pot boil-
ing... That appears to be the in-
tention. Let that not happen.""
Mehta was referring to the
Justice Gita Mittal Committee,
which was constituted by the SC
last August to address the hu-
manitarian concerns stemming
from the violence.
Mehta said an FIR had al-
ready been lodged in August and
November: ""My objection is not
delay only but we said that
whatever they have supplied has
been sent to CFSL and a report is
awaited. Whoever has uploaded
on their Twitter (X) account, we
have approached them also
(asking) if you have the original,
please give it to us so that (its ve-
racity can be checked).""
The CJI said, ""We are careful,
That's why I said in the begin-
ning itself. This should not be-
come another issue.""
""At the same time, I don't
know the contents of the tran-
scripts, and the veracity also.
That's for you people to exam-
ine... Let the FSL report come,""
the CJI added.
Meanwhile, the SC made it
clear that the state's objection as
to why the petitioner could not
have approached the HC will re-
main open and Monday's order
will have no bearing on it."

AMID A lull in incidents of vio-

have been put on high alert due to
gun battles and explosions near
the state's border with Myanmar
over the past week.
Fierce gunfights broke out in
the Sagaing region of Myanmar
- a country in the middle of a civil
war - on January 27. The area is
close to Manipur's Kamjong dis-
trict, Kamjong SP Ningshem
Vashum said firing has continued
close to the border. ""The firefights
are still taking place but across the
border, within the jurisdiction of
Myanmar, We are on high alert,
and along with the Assam Rifles,
we have opened three new check-
posts along the border - from
Namlee to Phaikok. Right now,
there is no border crossing hap-
pening on this stretch, and there
is no ripple on our side,"" he said,
Because the violence is taking
place across the border, officials
from the security forces deployed
in Manipur said they have no de-
tails of which groups are involved
or how many lives have been lost.
However, in the last week, three
different banned insurgent
groups from Manipur's Meitei-
majority valley, which have bases
in Myanmar, have claimed that
their cadres were killed,
On January 31, a public funeral
was held in Imphal East's Andro
area to honour a member of the
proscribed group People's
Liberation Army (PLA), who had
reportedly been killed in
Myanmar, close to the border, on
January 27,
In a statement, the
Revolutionary People's Front, the
armed wing of which is the PLA,
claimed that PLA ""2nd
Lieutenant"" Henthoiba had died
in an encounter with ""proxy en-
emies"". Following this, on
Sunday, two other valley-based
groups-the UNLF's Koireng fac-
tion and the KYKL-claimed that
they lost one member each on
January 30 in a gunfight against
the Kuki National Army-Burma
and the Indian military. Similar
allegations had also been made
last year by the Naga insurgent
group NSCN(IM), alleging ""proxy
warfare"" in Myanmar territory.
Indian security forces have
denied the allegations, Valley
based insurgent groups, which
have seen a rise in activities and
recruitment after the start of the
ongoing conflict in the state, have
bases in Myanmar, where they
are known to fight alongside the
military junta against the rebel
People's Defence Force and
Ethnic Armed Organisations, in-
cluding the KNA(B).
There have also been reports
of deaths of Kuki-Zo people in the
ongoing fights in Myanmar, close
to Kamjong. However, unlike the
valley-based insurgent groups, no
Kuki-Zo group has claimed the

Police said they had opened
an investigation into murder, ar-

possible further victims had con-

The shooting took place in
Orebro, some 200 km west of
Stockholm, at the Risbergska
school for adults who did not
complete their formal education.
It is located on a campus that also
houses schools for children.

on Sunday capture the

the Army, the need for
which is one of the key les-

BrahMos supersonic
cruise missiles, upgraded
Pinaka Multi-Rocket

with a range of 75 km,
BM-21 Grad, which is a 122
mm MRLS, and Pralay qua-

were among those show-
cased.
The Defence Research
and Development Organi-
sation (DRDO) showcased
a model of the indigenous
Advanced Towed Artillery
Gun System (ATAGS) on its
tableau.
In addition to Pralay, the
Army's new Battlefield Sur-
veillance System, Sanjay,
was at the parade for the
first time. Sanjay has been

ics Ltd. at a cost of ₹2,402
crore, and the systems will
be inducted in all opera-
tional brigades, divisions
and corps of the Army in
three phases between
March and October.
As one of the most ad-
vanced rocket systems glo-
bally, the fully automated
214 mm Pinaka MRLS bat
tery can deliver a salvo of
72 rockets on the target up
to 75 km in 44 seconds, the
commentary booklet dis-
tributed at the parade on
Sunday said. The Army has
four Pinaka regiments in
service and six more are on
order.
Twin-launched Pralay
The Pralay with a twin
launcher system show-
cased at the parade is a
quasi-ballistic missile and
India's first ballistic missile
designated for convention-
al role. Development trials
of Pralay are over and the
development is now com-
plete, as reported by The
Hindu earlier. The Defence
Acquisition Council has ac-
corded Acceptance of Ne-
cessity for a few hundred
of the missiles for the Army
and the Air Force. ""In
threat scenario, Pralay is
capable of destruction of
war waging potential of ad-
versary even before the
commencement of contact
battle owing to its flexible
range and lethality,"" the
booklet stated.
The upgraded Pinaka is
going to be the mainstay of
the Army's long-range
rocket artillery. Last No-
vember, the DRDO an-
nounced the successful
completion of flight tests of
guided Pinaka rockets of 75
km range, paving the way
for its induction by dou-
bling the original range of
37 km. Work is on to en-
hance the range to 300
km.
Last September, the Ar-
my's Director-General of
Artillery, Lt. Gen. Adosh
Kumar, said that the Pina-
ka system was being wide-
ly exploited and its ability
was second to none. ""We
are looking at extending
the range of the Pinaka
rockets and a lot of work is
going on. The DRDO is con-
fident of achieving it.""
In addition to Pinaka,
the Army has five Grad
rocket regiments and three
Smerch regiments with a
range of 90 km. Another
missile, Nirbhay sub-sonic
cruise missile, the longest
range option, is in an ad-
vanced stage of develop
ment trials and can be ex-
pected to be showcased in
the next few years.
Specialised ammunition
Another aspect adding to
the lethality of Pinaka is
specialised ammunition.
Trials have been complet-
ed using high-explosive
pre-fragmented rockets in
the Pinaka system, which
will increase the range by
15-20%, and an area denial
munition (ADM) system,
which can be anti-tank and
anti-personnel. Contracts
for procurement of both
are expected to be signed
soon, Lt. Gen. Kumar had
said.
The Grad proved its
worth during the 1999 Kar-
gil War when its ability to
deliver a salvo of 40 rock-
ets in just 20 seconds
played a key role in neutra-
lising fortified enemy posi-
tions on high-altitude ridg-
es. Initially mounted on
the Ural-3750 truck plat-
form, the BM-21 under-
went a significant upgrade,
transitioning to the indige-
nously developed Ashok
Leyland super stallion plat-
form. This upgrade en-

payload capacity, and
streamlined maintenance,
